Before leaving Siberia, probably for ever, I am desirous of recording
my gratitude for the assistance afforded me and the many kindnesses I
received during the winter I spent there. From the highest officials to
the humblest _employé_, the courtesy I was shown on all occasions was so
great, that in all my varied experiences of travel I remember nothing
to equal it; and if it is the same all over this mighty empire, I trust
that my wanderings will lead me some day into Greater Russia itself.
Amongst the many gentlemen to whom I owe a special debt of gratitude.
I may mention Mr. E. Wostrotine, in Yeniseisk; General Telakoffsky,
Dr. Peacock, and Messrs. Cheripanoff, Matwieff, and Kusnitsoff, in
Krasnoiarsk; General Grimiken, M. Soukatchoff, and Mr. Charles Lee, in
Irkutsk; and M. Feodroff and M. Shollingen, in Ourga.

PREFACE.


A few introductory remarks are, I feel, necessary, if only to give the
_raison d’être_ of my journey, and as a sort of apology for adding to the
already formidable array of books of Asiatic travel.

The celebrated voyage of Captain Wiggins in 1887, when he successfully
accomplished the feat of navigating a steamer (the _Phœnix_) across the
Kara Sea and up the river Yenisei to the city of Yeniseisk, is too well
remembered for it to be necessary for me to recapitulate an exploit which
is destined to become historic, solving as it did the much-vexed question
of the practicability of establishing commercial relations between
England and Siberia viâ the Arctic Ocean and the Kara Sea.

This successful expedition, opening up such immense possibilities,
naturally encouraged its financial promoters to follow it up by another
and much more important one. Towards the end of July in the following
year, therefore, the _Labrador_, a powerful wooden steamer specially
built for Arctic work, was despatched to the mouth of the Yenisei with
a cargo of “all sorts,” with which to try the Siberian market; the
_Phœnix_, which had been laid up for the winter at Yeniseisk, being
commissioned to proceed down the river and fetch back the cargo brought
out by the _Labrador_, the latter vessel being too large to be able to
get such a distance from the estuary. For all this, special permission
had naturally to be got from the Russian Government; but so far from
making any objections or putting any obstacles in the way of the
scheme, the officials, advised of course from head-quarters, lent every
assistance in their power and showed a most friendly spirit. Through a
diversity of causes, into which it is not necessary to enter here, the
expedition failed to accomplish its purpose, and the _Labrador_ returned
to England without having crossed the Kara Sea at all. An ordinary man
would have been discouraged, at any rate for a time, by such a failure;
but Wiggins is not of that stuff. Nothing daunted, he at once began
trying to raise “the sinews of war” for a fresh expedition, and was so
successful (such confidence had his friends in him), that the following
year the _Labrador_ once again started for the far North-East—but only to
meet with another failure, though this time the failure, it was proved
afterwards, could have been easily averted. In fact, so conclusively
was this proved, that, emboldened with the knowledge of how near it had
been to being a success, a syndicate of rich and influential London men
was without difficulty got together, and it was at once decided that two
ships should be sent out the following year, and that everything possible
should be done to ensure success. This time there were no half-hearted
measures; money was forthcoming, and with it a renewed enthusiasm in the
scheme, which, I may add parenthetically, helped not a little to bring
about its eventually satisfactory result; this notwithstanding the fact
that the expedition started handicapped by the untoward absence (owing to
his having met with shipwreck on his way to join us) of Captain Wiggins,
the leading spirit of the project.

Talking about Russia one morning with Mr. Ingram at the office of the
_Illustrated London News_, he suddenly suggested my going out as their
“special artist” with this expedition. The love of travel and the spirit
of adventure are so strong in me, that without the slightest hesitation
I eagerly caught at the idea; in fact, had he suggested my riding across
the Sahara on a bicycle I should probably have jumped at it with just as
much alacrity.

Well, to cut a long story short, after a lot of correspondence had passed
between us, the “Anglo-Siberian Trading Syndicate” agreed to take me,
subject to certain restrictions as to publication of sketches and matter
relating to the expedition, and to land me eventually, if all went well,
at the city of Yeniseisk, in the heart of Siberia. On my taking a map of
the route down to the office, and asking Mr. Ingram where I was to go if
I ever found myself there, “You can go wherever you like, so long as you
send us plenty of interesting sketches for the paper,” was his generous
reply. With liberty, therefore, to roam all over the world, so to speak,
and with unlimited time and plenty of means at my disposal, I started on
a journey, the narrative of which I now venture to put in print, in the
hope that at any rate some parts of it may give a few fresh facts about
the vast continent I traversed from north to south.

In conclusion, I must candidly confess I arrived in Siberia with foregone
conclusions derived from the unreliable information and exaggerated
stories so current in England about this part of the world. How far my
subsequent experiences dispelled the prejudices with which I started,
the reader of my narrative may judge for himself. I have touched but
_en passant_ on the exile and prison system, for nothing was further
from my thoughts, when I undertook the journey, than to make a profound
study of this question. Efforts in this direction have been made both by
prejudiced and unprejudiced writers, all of whom, however, are agreed
on the main point, that the system is an anachronism and unsuitable to
the present age. What I felt was that in Siberia, that vast country with
such immense natural resources, there must be much which would be novel
and interesting to study in its social aspect, apart from the actual
prison life and hardships with which the name of Siberia has always been
associated; so I determined to devote my chief attention to phases of
life which are still, in general, so little known that to many readers,
probably, much that I have attempted to describe in these pages will
come, as it did to me, in the light of a revelation.

FROM THE ARCTIC OCEAN TO THE YELLOW SEA.




CHAPTER I.

FROM BLACKWALL TO SIBERIA.

    The object of the expedition—The steamer _Biscaya_ and its
    passengers and cargo—Across the North Sea—Uncomfortable
    experiences—First glimpse of Norway—Aalesund—The Lofoden
    Islands—The midnight sun—A foretaste of the Arctic
    regions—“Cape Flyaway”—Our ice-master, Captain Crowther—We
    sight the coast of Siberia—The village of Kharbarova—The
    entrance to the Kara Sea.


[Illustration: THE “BISCAYA” LEAVING BLACKWALL.]

In these prosaic days of the nineteenth century one hardly expects a
revival of the adventurous expeditions which made the fame of England
in the days of Frobisher and Drake. As a matter of fact, the world is
almost too well known now for such adventures to be possible, even were
the leaders forthcoming, and the “good old buccaneering days” are long
past. Still, I could not help thinking, on the day we left Gravesend
for the far North-East, bound for a region but little known, and with
the uncertainty of ever reaching our destination, that it must have
been under somewhat similar conditions that the adventurers of old
started on their perilous journeys; with, however, this very great
difference—ours was not a filibustering expedition, but a commonplace
commercial enterprise, backed up by several well-to-do Englishmen, with
absolutely nothing of the romantic about it beyond the fact of its having
to traverse these wild and comparatively unknown regions before it could
be successfully achieved.

We started from the Thames on Friday, July 18, 1890, in the chartered
Norwegian steamer _Biscaya_, eight hundred tons gross, bound for the
Yenisei River with a nondescript tentative sort of cargo, consisting of
a mixture of all sorts, from a steam sawmill down to the latest toy for
children, our ultimate destination being the town of Yeniseisk, which is
situated some fifteen hundred miles from the mouth of this mighty river.
The object of the expedition was to endeavour to open a trade route
between England and Siberia by means of the Kara Sea passage, which was
discovered by Nordenskiold in 1875.

Nothing of particular interest occurred during the first few days
after we left the Thames. We were so closely packed that it required
some careful arrangement to get us all comfortably stowed, so to
speak. Imagine seven men jammed into a cabin just about large enough
to accommodate four, and each man with the usual amount of superfluous
luggage without which Englishmen could not possibly travel, this baggage
also stowed in the cabin, and you will guess that we were packed like
sardines. As, however, no doubt even sardines get used to being packed,
after a time so did we; and, although the passage across the North Sea
was about as uncomfortable a one as I ever experienced, we somehow
managed to settle into our respective grooves long before we sighted
the coast of Norway. Our party consisted of two representatives of the
London Syndicate, two engineers, a master stevedore (to unload the ship
on arrival), an experienced ice-master, who knew the Kara Sea thoroughly,
the captain of the _Biscaya_, and your humble servant. I don’t think I
ever was on board a more crowded ship. Even the decks were packed with
all sorts of paraphernalia, including a large steam-launch and several
pens of live stock; and, so as to obviate any fear of running short of
coal in the outlandish parts we were going to, the fore and upper decks
had over seventy tons of loose coal on them. We had a head wind and a
heavy sea nearly the whole way after passing Harwich, where we dropped
our pilot, thus bidding a last farewell to Old England. Off the Dogger
Bank we went right through the fishing fleet which congregates there,
and took advantage of the opportunity to get some fresh fish—a matter of
no small difficulty, as the men had a preposterous idea of its value:
they would not take money for it, but actually had the effrontery to
want to swop a couple of small cod, a ling, and a pair of soles for two
bottles of whiskey and a pound of tobacco! Fish is evidently dearer on
the fishing-ground itself than in London. Whiskey, however, was far more
valuable to us than fish, so, when the men saw we were not buyers on
their terms, they eventually came down to 1½ lb. of ship tobacco (value
2_s._ 4_d._) for the lot, which was reasonable enough. After passing the
Dogger Bank the wind freshened very considerably towards evening, and
added much to the discomfort of the crowded ship; in fact, so badly did
she roll about that not only was all our party busy “feeding the fishes”
most of the time, but our cook was also so ill that he could not attend
to his duties, and we all had to lend a hand in the galley as well as
we could. I had never been a long voyage in a wooden ship before, so
could hardly sleep a wink all night, owing to the (to me) unusual noise
caused by the groaning of her timbers as she pitched and tossed about.
It sounded not unlike what I should imagine it would be sleeping near a
lot of new leather portmanteaus which were being continually shifted.
During the whole of the following day it was blowing big guns, and the
sea was so heavy that the cabin was almost dangerous to remain in, owing
to the sort of cannonade of packages from all sides, many things being
damaged. There was absolutely nothing to do but sit down and wait events,
and, meanwhile, make one’s self as comfortable as one could under the
circumstances. By the next day the gale had moderated considerably, and
during the morning we got our first glimpse of Norway—a high, rock-bound
coast, with a dim vista of mountains in the background. Shortly after,
a small pilot-boat hove in sight, evidently on the chance of a job,
probably taking the _Biscaya_ for a tourist steamer wishing to pass
inside the islands, which is the most picturesque route, though somewhat
longer. We had no time, however, to waste on scenery, so, although one of
our party, who was suffering from an attack of dysentery, offered to pay
the pilotage (about £15) out of his own pocket if the calm-water channel
was followed, it was at once decided to keep outside the whole way up
the coast, and thus get on as fast as possible, more especially as the
weather showed signs of clearing up.

On the Norway coast we anchored for a short time off the quaint little
village of Aalesund, with its pretty wooden houses nestling under the
high snow-clad mountains which encircle the beautiful fiord on which it
is situated. I was disappointed on a nearer inspection of the village,
which looked so quaint as seen from the sea: the houses all appeared
to be almost new, doubtless owing to the fact that they are all built
entirely of wood. The effect is thoroughly characteristic of Norway, the
smell pervading the place especially so, being, as far as I could guess,
a mixture of paraffin and pickled fish, with just a _soupçon_ of burnt
wood thrown in here and there. Everything looked as clean as a new pin,
but, as each house is exactly like its neighbour, the effect is certainly
monotonous. Nevertheless, there were several pretty bits which I should
have liked to sketch had I had time. What, if anything, struck me most
was the entire absence of any national or picturesque costume, which
gives such local colour to most Continental villages. At Aalesund the
inhabitants looked for all the world like English people, and their fair
hair and blue eyes added to this resemblance. I was told, however, that
on _fête_ days there are some quaint costumes to be seen here and there.

No time was lost in getting away, and shortly after we had lost sight
of the quiet little village, where we had spent a few lazy hours, and
were heading it once more for the far-distant Arctic regions. The days
after this date began to lengthen considerably, and, although we had
hardly noticed it at first, it astonished us very much when we suddenly
found that it was eleven o’clock at night, and yet the sun was shining as
brightly as during the afternoon. When the novelty had worn off, as it
naturally did after a few days, the amount of daylight almost palled on
one. It seemed too absurd turning in while the sun was up; still, like
everything else, one gets used to it after a time. The next few days were
uneventful, as we were out of sight of land, and the usual monotony of
shipboard life was only broken by the usual skylarking, without which no
sea voyage would be complete.

On July 28 we sighted the Lofoden Islands, about fourteen miles off on
our starboard quarter. It was a lovely morning, and the lofty snow-capped
mountains towering against the calm eastern sky presented a grand and
impressive sight. The effect was almost that of a colossal painting,
so still was everything in the bright sunshine. I was so impressed
by the quiet grandeur of the scene that I got out my paint-box and
started a sketch, but only succeeded in making a sort of caricature of
my impressions. Late the next evening we came across a fleet of small
fishing-boats—about the quaintest lot of craft I ever saw: they looked
as if they had been copied from the frontispiece of the _Argosy_. We got
some coarse sort of fish from them in exchange for tobacco, biscuits,
and the inevitable rum. The men were a very fine-looking set of fellows,
very much like Englishmen (as, in fact, most Norwegians are), and seemed
quite comfortable in their ramshackle-looking boats. After leaving them
we saw for the first time the curious phenomenon of the sun above the
horizon at midnight. It was so bright, and the atmosphere so clear, that
I took an instantaneous photograph of a group on deck, and it came out
very well.

The next morning we arrived off the North Cape, and passed it close in
to the shore. We were now well inside the Arctic Circle, but perceived
no difference whatever in the temperature, except that perhaps it was
warmer than it had been previously. As a matter of fact, we had out the
hose and took a most enjoyable bath on deck in the warm sunshine. In the
afternoon, however, we had our first taste of the Arctic regions, as a
dense fog came on, and lasted till late in the evening. Everything seemed
saturated with moisture; the very rigging was dripping as under a heavy
shower.

[Illustration: PREPARATIONS FOR THE ARCTIC REGIONS.

[_To face p. 8._]

For the next few days nothing of interest occurred, when suddenly one
morning, as we were nearing Kolguier Island, we were aroused by the news
that there was a steamer in sight, and soon we were all on deck eagerly
scanning the horizon. Considering how far we were from the ordinary track
of vessels, our excitement was natural; for what was a ship doing in
these outlandish parts? We soon made out that it was a large steamer,
coming from due north straight towards us. She was coming at such a
spanking rate that very soon we could see she was flying the Russian
flag; and shortly after she passed round our stern, and we dipped our
colours to each other as she did so. She then brought up, and stopped not
far from us, while our captain hailed her in English, and asked if they
would take some letters ashore for us. With difficulty, we understood
their reply to be “Yes.” When, however, in their turn, they asked us
where we were bound for, and got the reply “Siberia,” they seemed
somewhat astonished, as well they might, for “Siberia” is vague. We then
lowered a boat, and sent them our packet of letters; after which, bidding
each other farewell by means of our fog-horns, we continued our way. We
subsequently learnt from the mate, who had been in the boat, that it was
a steamer which had been sent to Nova Zemla to try and discover a Russian
ship, which had been lost there some months back.

[Illustration: A “DEAD RECKONING” IN THE KARA SEA.]

During the remainder of that day our course was again obscured by thick
fog, which prevented us from sighting Kolguier Island in the afternoon
as we had expected. When, however, we came on deck after tea, a curious
incident occurred. Our ice-master, who had been intently looking through
his glasses at something which had attracted his attention, suddenly
declared that he saw land on the horizon behind us. We were all naturally
somewhat startled at this intelligence, as we hardly expected to see it
in so distant a quarter, for even had we passed Kolguier in the fog, at
the rate we were going it could not possibly have been so far away from
us in the time. But what land was it, then? for on looking through our
glasses we certainly did see high mountains capped here and there with
snow, their base lost in the surrounding mist. On consulting the chart
we were not a bit the wiser, for it seemed as doubtful as ourselves. I
give, as a proof, the following “caution,” which is printed on the “Map
of the Coast of Russia included between Cape Kanin and Waygatch Island”
(Imray, 1883): “As the sea comprised within the limits of this chart is
very imperfectly known, no survey of any portion of it having been made,
it should be navigated with more than ordinary care. The geographical
positions of headlands and islands are all, without exception, uncertain,
and their general delineation is only approximately accurate.” (This
is from the map we were then consulting.) After a while, however, the
mysterious land gradually disappeared in the distance; and, as we shortly
after sighted the looked-for Kolguier Island ahead of us, there can be
very little doubt that the mountains we thought we saw were part of what
the sailors call “Cape Flyaway.” It was a most realistic effect, and,
even seen through powerful glasses, was exactly like land.

The sunset that evening was magnificent; in fact, I never remember seeing
such glorious sky effects anywhere else as I have observed in these
latitudes, the most wonderful part of them being their extraordinary
stillness. For at least an hour I have frequently noticed masses of
cumuli absolutely unchanged either in shape or position.

The days were now beginning to get shorter again, although it was still
broad daylight all night (if such an expression is English), the sun
remaining below the horizon a few minutes longer every day. By the way,
I believe we were fortunate in getting in the neighbourhood of the North
Cape exactly on the last day in the year, when the sun is visible above
the horizon at midnight. All of us were now anxiously looking forward
to getting a glimpse of the coast of Siberia, and yet the weather was
so warm and the sea so calm and blue that it was more like yachting in
the Mediterranean than a voyage through the dreary Arctic regions; in
fact, on August 4, when we at length sighted the land, the sun was simply
broiling. Lovely, however, as the day was, it seemed to have very little
effect on the dreary-looking coast-line, for a more dismal and uninviting
country I never saw, flat and uninteresting right down to the very
water’s edge, and with a striking absence of any colour, except a dingy
muddy brown. This, of course, is easily accounted for, as it is only for
two or three short months that the ground is free from snow, and there is
no vegetation in these regions.

[Illustration: OUR ICE-MASTER, CAPTAIN CROWTHER.]

Captain Crowther, our ice-master, a veteran Arctic traveller, who was
out with the _Eira_ expedition in 1881-2, and is the only man on board
who knows these parts, now assumed the command of the ship, and took
up his position on the bridge. We were about to enter the Kara Sea by
the Waygatch Straits, and it was uncertain as yet if the navigation was
open, as this remote sea is never entirely free from ice. It was to be an
exciting time for the next hour or so, for, if our passage through the
Straits was blocked, we should have to return and try and get round by
the coast of Nova Zemla, a much longer and still more doubtful route.
Sailing as we were, on a summer sea and in the warm sunshine, one could
hardly realize that, perhaps a mile or so ahead, we might find our
passage blocked by impenetrable ice; it seemed so utterly improbable as
to be hardly worth the thought. But we did not know the Arctic regions
yet.

We soon reached the entrance to the Straits, which are formed by the
Island of Waygatch on one side and Siberia on the other, and are only
about one and a half mile across, passing so close to the shore that we
could plainly distinguish the battered wreck of a small vessel lying on
the beach near a primitive sort of wooden beacon, which seemed strangely
out of place in so melancholy a spot. Some distance farther, on the
Siberian side, we could see the small hamlet of Khabarova, consisting of
about a dozen wooden huts or cottages clustered round a little church,
with a few fishing-coracles drawn up on the shingle in front, while a
short distance away were several Polar bear skins hanging up to dry. It
looked unutterably sad, this poor little outpost of humanity so far away
from the busy world. One could not help wondering what inducement this
dreary Arctic waste could possibly offer for any one to wish to dwell in
it. I hear, however, that a few Russian merchants live there, carrying
on a sort of trade with the Samoyede natives in return for furs, walrus
tusks, etc.

Up till now we had been having real summer weather, with rippling waves
sparkling in the brilliant sunshine. Suddenly the scene changed, and,
with barely any warning, a drenching shower came down, and with it the
wind veered round to the north-east, dark clouds obscured the sky, and
as we entered the Kara Sea the effect was indescribably weird. It was
like going from daylight into a horrid, uncanny sort of twilight. Behind
us we could still see the lovely sunshine we had just left, while ahead
the scene was Arctic in the extreme, and thoroughly realized my wildest
expectations. All was cold and wretched, with a wintry sky overhead.
Under the low cliffs which encircled the dreary shore one could see huge
drifts of snow which the sunshine of the short Arctic summer had been
powerless to disperse, while for miles round the sea simply bristled with
drift ice in all sorts of uncouth shapes. I felt that it would require
the pencil of a Doré or the pen of a Jules Verne to convey any adequate
idea of the weird scene in all its desolate grandeur.

[Illustration: CLEARING THE DRIFT ICE FROM THE PROPELLER.]

Notwithstanding its unpromising aspect, our plucky ice-master put the
_Biscaya_ straight for the icy obstacles, and soon we were surrounded on
all sides by ghostly shapes, which appeared to be hurrying past us like
so many uneasy spirits under the leaden sky. Although the ship was well
and skillfully handled, in a very short time we were actually blocked
in on all sides by huge masses of ice, and remained so for several
hours. Then the floes drifted sufficiently to allow of our gradually
wedging our way through, which we did with considerable difficulty and
not without several severe bumps; in fact, it was a wonder to me how
we managed to get through at all, still more without serious damage.
Curiously enough, all the ice for the moment seemed to be gathered in one
spot, for the sea beyond was clear for several miles ahead after this;
then more drifts appeared, and during the night we were again hemmed in
on all sides.

The next morning the sun was shining in a cloudless sky once more, a
great contrast to our previous evening’s experience, and the effect of
the snow-white drift-ice floating on the blue sea was very beautiful
and novel. This time the water was sufficiently clear ahead to allow
of our passage without much difficulty, and we proceeded without any
special incident for several hours. Towards the afternoon, however, we
observed a curious effect on the horizon before us: it was a sort of
white reflection in the sky. Our experienced ice-master, who had been
up to the mast-head with his glasses, however, did not look at it in
the same light as we did; to him it was neither novel nor interesting.
He told us that it was the reflection in the sky of enormous fields of
ice, which it would be impossible to get through, unless we found a
passage in some part of it. For the moment he could see nothing for it
but to turn back and try another course, as the sea ahead was blocked
on either side as far as he could see. This did not sound cheerful, as
it immediately raised visions of wintering in the Arctic regions, if,
indeed, our ship was not smashed up before then. Without any delay the
_Biscaya’s_ head was immediately turned right round to the southeast, in
the hope of finding a clear passage, and creeping north again under the
shelter of the land. It was wearisome work going right back again over
the old ground, but this was but a forerunner of what we had to do for
some time afterwards, and by the time we had done with the Kara Sea we
had all learnt a good lesson in patience. So as to economize the coal, we
only steamed half-speed ahead all the time. After several hours on this
course, it was decided once more to try our luck and get northward again,
and all that night we went steadily on without meeting with any ice.

The next morning, when we got up on deck, a most provoking sight awaited
us. We were steaming very slowly, for a few miles ahead of us was the
wall of ice we had been trying in vain to avoid. There it lay, stretched
out as far as the eyes could reach on either side in the bright sunshine,
a ghostly barrier between us and our route. Our ice-master was pacing the
deck in a very restless manner, and evidently did not like the look of
affairs at all. At last he told us that it was no good humbugging about
it: we were fairly in for it. As far as he could judge, the Kara Sea was
full of ice to the north, so that the only thing we could do was to dodge
about on the chance of finding a weak spot to try and get through. If we
did not succeed in finding a passage, he thought “it would be a very long
job before we got out of the ice.” His language was forcible enough to
carry weight with it, even if his experience had not, so once more the
ship’s course was altered, and we started on a fresh voyage of discovery,
westward this time. All that day we were pounding along the fringe of
the interminable fields of ice, when, towards evening, it was decided
to try what appeared to be a sort of opening some few miles ahead,
although it did not look a very hopeful undertaking. For an hour or so,
however, before making the attempt, the engines were slowed down as much
as possible, in order to give our captains an opportunity of taking a
little rest, as they knew that, once inside the ice, there would be no
time for sleeping. At eight o’clock the ship’s head was turned due north
again, and in a very short time we were entirely surrounded by ice, which
seemed to get more and more compact as we advanced, if advance it could
be called; for at times we barely moved at the rate of a mile an hour,
with continual stoppages to enable the men to clear away the drift-ice
from the propeller. Round us was an extraordinary scene, and one which
I hardly know how to describe. There was not a breath of air stirring;
in the growing twilight the sea looked like polished glass, and on it
the floating ice, which was rapidly melting, took all sorts of weird
and grotesque shapes, conjuring up visions of low tide on some immense
shore in antediluvian days, with uncouth monsters disporting themselves
in the shallow water. We were so much impressed by our surroundings that
we remained on deck watching the slowly moving panorama all night, or,
rather, during the hours which are usually night, for it was but a sort
of mysterious twilight all the time, which considerably added to the
effect.

[Illustration: THE HOME OF THE WALRUS-HUNTER.]

Towards morning we got into somewhat clearer water, when, to our great
surprise, we sighted some vessels ahead of us in the ice. They turned
out to be walrus-hunters, and, on our getting up to the nearest one, a
sort of sloop with a crow’s-nest at the mast-head, with a man in it on
the look-out, they sent a boat over to us, and we then learnt that they
were all in the same fix as ourselves, and had been blocked in for some
days past, as they also wanted to get north. They hailed from Hammerfest,
and had been in the Kara Sea since April, but hoped to be able to get
out and on their way back to Norway towards the end of August. One of
our party, an enthusiastic curio-hunter (without which no party could
be complete), immediately “scented” his prey, and on inquiry found that
the men had on board a Polar bear’s skin they could sell him, also some
sealskins and walrus tusks; so we jumped into their boat, and they took
us across to have a look at them while their captain and ours hobnobbed
together and talked Norwegian to their heart’s content in the _Biscaya’s_
cabin. On nearer inspection, the sloop proved larger than we had imagined
it, and certainly dirtier. In a few minutes a cask was hauled up out of
the hold, and a large yellowy-brown bundle, covered thickly with wet
salt, pulled out of it and spread on the greasy deck. This was the Polar
bear’s skin we had come to see. Our curio-hunter’s enthusiasm went down
to zero at once, for it was as unlike the snowy-white rugs one sees in
London drawing-rooms as chalk is to cheese; still, they actually asked
the modest sum of £5 for it in this dirty state. The sealskins were also
very disappointing, and we were about to return to the boat, when one of
the crew produced a lot of Samoyede costumes and walrus tusks, which we
all made a rush for, as, at any rate, they were interesting—and clean.
Of such there were enough to satisfy us all, and they were soon bought
up. I got off cheapest, as I managed to get some very curious articles in
return for my Waterbury watch, which took the man’s fancy. On returning
to the _Biscaya_ we found that it had been arranged to tow the sloop a
short distance, as its captain said he knew the coast, and thought he
could pilot us through the ice part of the way. The ships therefore got
under way in company, and most of us then turned in for a few hours,
after a most fatiguing day.

In the morning we were at a standstill, fairly blocked in on all sides
by the ice, which glistened and sparkled round us till one’s eyes ached
from the glare. The sea was as calm as a mill-pond, the sun was shining
in a cloudless sky, and it was so warm that had it not been for the ice
around I should have suggested having the hose out and a bath on deck,
for the thermometer marked fifty degrees in the shade. It was simply
delightful, and made one feel quite pleased to be alive, so to speak.
I could not help thinking, as I breathed the exhilarating air, how few
Londoners have ever experienced such delight, as inhaling this sort of
air seems to impart to one a kind of desire to jump about and give vent
to one’s animal spirits in quite a schoolboyish fashion, reminding one
of one’s youthful days before the cares of manhood were upon us, when
on the weekly half-holiday the rush was made for the cricket-ground.
Owing to the purity of the atmosphere, the refraction or mirage along
the horizon was so great that the ice seemed to be literally standing
straight up, thus producing the impression of our being surrounded by
a high white wall or cliff—an almost indescribable effect, and which,
when seen through the glasses, reminded one of a transformation scene
at a theatre, when the background is formed of painted gauze which
is gradually lifted to disclose further surprises behind. A long and
wearisome delay now occurred, as it was manifestly absurd even to try and
advance any farther in the direction we were in. At last it was decided
that the _Biscaya_ should get out again into the open sea as soon as
possible, as our ice-master did not like the look of the huge masses of
ice which were pressing tightly on her sides. The walrus-hunter expressed
his intention of remaining where he was for a few days, to try and get
some seals. Before parting company we entrusted to his care a packet of
letters which he promised to post at the first port he touched at—rather
a vague promise on his part, as he was uncertain when he would return
to civilization. However, it was worth chancing, as he might possibly
get back before we reached the end of our long journey. I could not help
wondering how long my letter would take to reach the Strand, and felt
certain I should never find a more uncertain post-office than this one.

[Illustration: THE “BISCAYA” ICE-BOUND IN THE KARA SEA.

[_To face p. 24._]

For the next few days we were dodging the ice in all directions. North,
south, east, and west, everywhere it seemed to be closing in on us, till
at last, during a futile effort to break through, we got so hemmed in
that it was deemed advisable to anchor to a floe for a time, and see if
there was any chance of the drifts breaking up with the advancing season.
So we brought up at a huge field of hummocky ice, and some men were
sent down with the ice-anchor. Most of us then enjoyed our first bit of
exercise for a fortnight. It was a novel experience being on one of these
floating islands. Though not very slippery, one had to be careful. Along
the edges the water deepened gradually, as upon a shore, for a couple of
yards or so, till where the ice ended, when it suddenly went off into
hundreds of fathoms, which looked like a black abyss beneath us. There
was very little to see, however, and, although we took our rifles with
us, we did not meet with a single living object, still less a bear or a
walrus, as we had fondly hoped we might.

[Illustration: AFTER SEALS.]

The next few days passed quietly. I managed to do a little sketching,
although it was chilly work for one’s feet on the ice. Then the weather
changed, and it came on to rain, with a thick fog accompanying it, so we
found the close and stuffy cabin very cosy after being in the bleak wind
outside, and, if singing (or, rather, making an infernal row) could help
to pass away the time, we certainly did our best to lose no opportunity,
our only drawback being that we had not a single musical instrument among
us. However, as it generally only was a question who could invent the
most unearthly noise to accompany the “songs,” the result can be more
easily imagined than described. Sometimes we managed to get a shot at
a stray seal which was rash enough to come within range, but, as they
invariably dived down immediately we had fired, we could never tell if
they had been hit or not, still less get them. One brute, with a face
like that of an old man, was particularly “cheeky.” He would come up
alongside and almost stand up in the water and have a good look at us,
as much as to say, “Here I am, you fellows! Why don’t you try and get
me? But you know you can’t!” Then, by the time we had got our rifles
and ammunition ready, he would disappear suddenly, and a few seconds
after come up on the other side of the ship. After a little of this
sort of thing we simply got mad, and at last there was quite a battery
waiting for him when he did appear. The ice-master, who was up at the
mast-head, and could, from that elevated position, see him quite plainly
under the water, directed our movements, and when at last we got a shot
at him grew awfully excited, yelling out, “That’s it! Hit him again
in the same place, and you’ll get him!” We did not get him, however,
for the poor brute dived down, leaving a track of blood in the water,
and did not reappear. We then got out a boat, and went on a sort of
hunting-expedition round about, but without finding anything; in fact, we
came to the conclusion, after paddling about for half an hour, that there
was nothing to find, so we gave it up as a bad job.

At last it was decided to up anchor and once more try our luck, as our
captains, and, in fact, all of us, were getting impatient at the delay,
unavoidable though it was. The rain appeared to have loosened the floes
considerably, so we were a bit more hopeful.

[Illustration: “ONE SPECK OF LIFE IN THE ICE-BOUND WASTE.”]

The novelty of being blocked in on all sides by fields of ice soon
wears off. Even the chance of a shot at a seal now and again fails to
enliven one. The silence of the surroundings is too oppressive; all
seems dead, and it seems like some hideous dream to row about on these
motionless waters, with the ghostly frozen monstrosities floating around.
It reminded one of Doré’s illustrations to Dante’s “Inferno.” One can
realize how awful it must be to be forced to pass a winter in the far
North, where continual night is added to the horrors of the death-like
surroundings. The silence of the great forest Stanley tells us of in his
book must be almost noisy (if one can use the expression) compared with
it; at any rate, he had living nature around him, whereas in the Arctic
regions all is gloom and eternal silence, without even vegetation to
enliven it. Before leaving the floe to which we had been anchored, out of
curiosity I ascertained the thickness of the ice, and to my astonishment
I found it averaged seventeen feet, some pieces being even as much
as _twenty-five feet_ in thickness, and this after several weeks of
continuous thaw.

It would take too long to describe the wearisome attempts we made during
the next few days while trying to break through the immense barrier which
lay between us and the mouth of the Yenisei River, and during all this
time we experienced every variety of Arctic climate, from hot sunshine to
sudden and icy cold fogs. This delay was trying to our patience, for time
was precious, as we had to get up the river, discharge cargo, and get the
ship off again on her return journey to England before the winter ice
set in, otherwise it meant her being fixed in the Kara Sea till the late
spring of next year. At length from the mast-head one evening came the
long-expected and joyful intelligence that there was clear water visible
ahead, and our ice-master reported having discovered what he thought
looked like a passage to it. This was good news indeed, as the monotony
of the last few days was beginning to pall on us, and we were none of us
grieved when, after a few more hours of slow steaming, the intelligence
proved correct, and we at last saw a clear horizon before us. Even then
a new and unexpected danger presented itself. A gale had been blowing,
and, although inside the ice-floes all was calm as in a lagoon, outside
a heavy sea was running, and the enormous masses of loose ice were being
tossed about like corks. It was an awful sight, and one of the utmost
danger to the _Biscaya_, as it was most difficult to steer clear of
the huge heaving masses which threatened at any moment to smash into
us. Fortunately, however, we managed to pass through them without the
slightest injury to the ship, and we gave a hearty cheer for our skipper
when we found ourselves once more out in the open sea, and the order was
given, for the first time for many days, “Full speed ahead!”

Before quite leaving the ice behind, I must tell you of a very funny
practical joke our captain played on us while we were at anchor. One
morning, at about three o’clock, when we were all fast asleep, we were
aroused by the captain rushing into our cabin in a state of great
excitement, and calling out to us that there was a bear on the ice close
by. To jump out of one’s bunk and make for one’s rifle was the work of
a moment, while the captain, who appeared to be in a frantic state of
excitement at the chance of such capital sport, was rushing about looking
for his ammunition. In a few seconds, and without waiting to put on coat
or slippers, I was out on the deck, with nothing on but my pyjamas, in
order to get the first shot if possible. I found all the crew looking
over the bulwarks. It was broad daylight, a cold, raw sort of morning,
with a dense fog enveloping everything a few yards ahead. About a hundred
yards away, on a huge piece of ice which was slowly drifting towards us,
was a large animal looming out through the mist. It was too far away
to be distinctly made out, but there it was undoubtedly—a Polar bear.
It would make for the water before I could get a shot, so without the
slightest hesitation I commenced blazing away. It was so cold standing
out in the frosty air, with scarcely anything on and coming straight
from one’s warm bed, that I could scarcely hold my rifle, still less
distinguish the dim outline in the distance at which I fired four rounds
in rapid succession, as I expected every minute the other fellows would
turn up before I could hit it. All at once, the mass of ice having by
this time drifted nearer, the animal turned slowly round towards us,
and started a plaintive bleating. “Why, it’s only a sheep!” I fairly
yelled, as I now made out its form quite distinctly. Immediately there
rose from all sides such shrieks of laughter as were never heard before
in the Arctic regions, I imagine; the crew simply rolled about the
deck in convulsions. As to the captain and the others, they nearly
went into fits. To my astonishment, I then saw one of the ship’s boats
which had been waiting on the other side put off to fetch back the
pseudo-bear—which was only one of our own sheep, after all, and which the
captain, as a joke, had himself put on the ice, rightly guessing that in
our half-awakened state none of us would hit it. The others, however,
did not turn out quickly enough, so I was the sole beneficiary of what
was one of the funniest practical jokes I ever heard of, and I laughed
as heartily as any of them when I “twigged” it all. It was no use going
back to bed again directly, so, to show I could appreciate a good bit of
fun, and to keep out the cold, we opened a bottle of whiskey, and spent
a pleasant hour, while laughing again and again at the description of
how I looked, rushing out on deck in my pyjamas, half asleep, and firing
wildly over the side of the ship. The sheep (which had been condemned for
mutton), in recognition of its valour while under fire, was reserved as
our very last victim for the flesh-pot.

We were once more fairly on our way towards the Yenisei, and, although
we sighted a great deal more ice, we encountered none which formed any
serious obstacle; we evidently had passed the worst. On August 11 we got
as far north as it was necessary for us to go (our position being at the
time 75 deg. north), and probably very few of us will ever get so near
the North Pole again. It was a real Arctic day, as I take it, wretchedly
cold, with heavy rain and a dense fog, so there was nothing for it but to
remain in the cabin all day. In the afternoon we crossed the estuary to
the river Ob, and—curious phenomenon—passed through fresh water for some
hours. We got some on deck, and found it drinkable though brackish.

It was now only a question of making up for lost time, as it had been
arranged that the river steamer, the _Phœnix_, should come from Yeniseisk
and meet us at the mouth of the river about August 12, which would
give us ample time to get out from England, allowing for delays. We
reached our place of rendezvous on the 13th—wonderful time, all things
considered—and brought up opposite the little station of Golchika,
without seeing anything of the ship which ought to have been waiting for
us. The river here was about ten miles wide, and the coast on either side
was as bare and desolate as that we had seen when passing through the
Waygatch Straits. It was profanely though graphically described by one of
our party, who remarked that it looked as if it were “the last place God
had made, and He had forgotten to finish it!”

[Illustration: THE HANDSOMEST MEMBER OF HIS FAMILY.]

In reply to our gun, which we fired as a signal, a boatful of men put
off from the land, and soon reached the ship, and then we had before us
our first visitors from the kingdom of the White Czar. There were six
of them—two Russians, and the rest Samoyede natives. Good specimens of
the Mongolian race, they were dressed in what looked like undressed
sheepskin of great age, judging from its colour, the fur being worn
inside next their bodies. The two Russians were dressed in the usual
peasant costume of the country. We could none of us make ourselves
understood, although I got out my guide-book and vainly tried to
pronounce some jaw-dislocating words; so we stood grinning at each other
for several minutes, till some one thought of offering them a cigarette.
This time no interpreter was necessary. What we wanted to find out from
them was whether they had seen anything of the _Phœnix_, but could
not make them understand; in fact, our difficulty now was to get rid
of them—to let them know we were pleased to have had the pleasure of
meeting them, but that “enough was as good as a feast.” As they did not
understand a hint, we simply pointed down to their boat, waving our hands
to them as a sign for them to depart; this they acted on, but not before
they had insisted on shaking hands with us all round—rather a trying
ordeal. After their departure, it was decided to anchor in mid-stream and
wait a few hours for the _Phœnix_ before we attempted reaching the next
station without a pilot.

[Illustration: SAMOYEDE BOATMEN.

[_To face p. 34._]

In the mean time, the steam-launch we had on board was got out and put in
readiness. The following day, there still being no signs of the _Phœnix_,
it was decided to attempt to reach the next station, Karaoul, a distance
of about a hundred and sixty miles, without her, as it was thought she
might have met with an accident on her way down with so many lighters
in tow; so, with the launch a few hundred yards ahead taking soundings,
the _Biscaya_ left Golchika, and started up the river in the hope of
seeing the missing ship. We made slow but sure progress, considering we
had no pilot, and how imperfect our only chart was, and it certainly was
a bit of luck that we got on so well as we did, as the river is full of
sandbanks. No incident worthy of note occurred. It was blowing a nasty
head wind all the time, so those in the launch had a rough and wet time
of it, as the river averaged three miles wide the whole way, and there
was no shelter whatever; yet they stuck to their work manfully, although
they were nearly swamped several times by the heavy seas. Towards evening
the next day we came in sight of a solitary log-cabin on the dreary
shore, with a dilapidated sort of storehouse next to it; close to the
water’s edge stood a Samoyede tent with a lot of native dogs lying round
it; all about were empty casks and other miscellaneous rubbish. Not a
human being was in sight. We had safely accomplished the risky voyage
from Golchika without a pilot; for this wretched little station off which
we dropped anchor, with all our colours flying, was Karaoul, the goal of
the _Biscaya’s_ voyage.




CHAPTER IV.

THE PORT OF KARAOUL AND ITS INHABITANTS.

    The tundras of Northern Siberia—The Samoyedes—Arrival of the
    _Phœnix_—My first Russian meal—Vodka and tea—Our departure for
    Kasanskoi.


[Illustration: KARAOUL.]

In my last chapter I told you how we had safely reached Karaoul, the
destination of the _Biscaya_, and that, to our great disappointment, the
ship which ought to have been there to meet us was not at the rendezvous.
What could have happened to her? Naturally, the first idea that suggested
itself was that she had run aground and was unable to get off, encumbered
as she was with the heavy barges that she was towing down from Yeniseisk
to take back our cargo in. It was manifestly out of the question
attempting to proceed any farther without a pilot, so it was decided to
wait where we were, in the hope of the _Phœnix_ turning up during the
next day or two.

In the evening we all went ashore to have a look round, and were received
on landing by quite a pack of native dogs, which, however, only offered
a mild protest against an invasion by barking at us from a distance. A
limp-looking individual, dressed in the usual Russian costume, with the
inevitable top-boots, strolled listlessly down towards the beach with his
hands in his pockets, and stared at us in an aimless sort of fashion.
The dismal loneliness of the surroundings had evidently had their effect
on him, and he was incapable of arousing himself to anything requiring
a mental effort, for he did not evince the slightest interest in our
arrival, strange and unusual though it certainly must have been to him
in this out-of-the-way sort of place. We found, however, that he still
retained the use of his tongue, and my slight knowledge of German then
proved very useful, as it turned out he was not a Russian, but hailed
from the “Vaterland.” He informed us that he was the only white man in
the place (which, by the way, only contained as many inhabitants as there
are letters in its name), and usually spent the summer months there
looking after the Samoyede fishermen who were working for the merchant
who owned the dilapidated wooden buildings. In the winter he was employed
as a butcher at Yeniseisk, and very glad he was to get back again there,
as he said he had a fearfully dull time of it here, with not a soul to
speak to except the Samoyedes, and very little work to do even when fish
was brought in to salt. One could not help pitying a man who was so down
on his luck as to be obliged to bury himself alive so far from his native
land in order to earn his daily bread.

There was not much to see on the beach, so we started for a walk over the
hills, and had a very pleasant ramble through country which reminded one
not a little of the Scottish Highlands. Everywhere we were knee-deep in
luxuriant grasses and moss, while all around flowers were growing in wild
profusion—it was almost like being in a huge deserted garden. I noticed
no end of old friends, such as the wild thyme, campanella, and mountain
daisy. It was hard to realize that the ground is eternally frost-bound a
foot or so beneath the surface, and that all this wonderful vegetation
only comes up during the few months when the ground is not covered
with snow; for during the greater part of the year there is absolutely
nothing to relieve the white vista of the endless rolling plains, which
are then deserted by even the aborigines themselves. We came across a
solitary Samoyede grave on the hillside, the spot being marked by two
sledges standing ready packed as for a journey. The Samoyedes thus leave
their dead, and the custom is almost touching in its simplicity. All the
earthly belongings of the deceased are placed on the sledges, covered
with a reindeer skin, and abandoned to the mercy of the elements, with no
other protection than a rudely carved forked stick stuck in the ground
close by to frighten away evil spirits. They have no fear of robbers,
as they know that their own people would not desecrate a grave, and to
strangers the few primitive articles on the sledges would not offer much
temptation; still, I must confess, it rather made my mouth water to see
such a lot of tempting curiosities thus abandoned.

[Illustration: THE SAMOYEDE’S GRAVE.]

On our way back to the ship we had a look in at the loghouse, and one
look was almost enough for most of us, as the heat inside was simply
stifling; for, although it was quite a warm summer evening, all the
windows appeared to be hermetically closed, and the large stove was in
full blaze. There was nothing particularly striking about the interior,
which was but a poor Russian home. I could not help remarking the extreme
order in which the place was kept; everything seemed to have its place,
to which it was scrupulously returned when moved.

[Illustration: A SAMOYEDE LADY.]

We then paid a visit _en passant_ to the Samoyede hut, or tent, or
whatever they call the bundle of dirty rags that serves them for a
sort of shelter. Inside we saw an old man, two women, and four or five
half-naked children huddled together, in an indescribable state of filth,
round a few smoking embers which were intended to represent a fire. The
stench was so great that it seemed more like looking at a den of wild
beasts than at human beings. The river might have been ten miles away,
instead of only as many yards, for all the use they ever made of it.

It had been decided that the next day our steam launch should be sent
on a voyage of discovery up the unknown reaches of the mighty river, in
search of the missing _Phœnix_. The launch had already been thoroughly
overhauled, so without delay a supply of provisions, sufficient to last
at least three months, was put on board of her, and three of our party
told off for the expedition. At eight o’clock the next morning all was in
readiness, and the little launch, packed absolutely to the gunwale and
towing a boat full of coal for her engine, started on her venturesome
journey, her crew looking very uncomfortable in their cramped quarters:
still, as it was a lovely day, the sun shining brilliantly, it almost
made one envy them their trip, if they had such weather all the time.
There was just a slight mist on the river, so they were not long getting
out of sight, blowing us a final good-bye with their steam whistle, to
which we replied by firing a volley with our rifles. Our now reduced
party then returned to the cabin to finish breakfast, wondering how long
we were doomed to wait at Karaoul in glorious inactivity.

At the end of the meal, as we were getting up from table, we were
startled by hearing the launch’s whistle blowing with great vigour close
at hand. We all rushed on deck, fearing some accident had befallen
her, when, to our astonishment, we saw her returning at full speed,
while close behind her, towering above the mist and with all her
colours flying, was the ship she had gone in search of. We were simply
dumbfounded, as the situation was almost too absurd; for, had the mist
only lifted, or the launch been detained only a quarter of an hour, we
must have seen her before her pursuer could have started, and thus saved
ourselves a lot of trouble. As may be imagined, the gallant crew of the
launch came in for a lot of good-humoured chaff, and we were able to
congratulate them on the successful result of their mission and their
safe return. In a very short time the _Phœnix_ was alongside, and we then
learnt that she had been delayed by the number of barges she had had to
tow—so much so, in fact, that, in order to save time, it had been decided
to leave most of them some twenty miles behind, at a convenient spot,
and come on with only one, so as to commence the transhipment without
any more unnecessary delay, and then return for the rest. No time was
lost, therefore; and in less than an hour after we had shaken hands with
those on board the steamer, our hatches were off, the steam winches going
merrily, and the cargo being rapidly taken out of the hold, under the
supervision of a stately Russian custom-house officer, who was attended
by two Cossacks.

[Illustration: TRANSHIPMENT OF OUR CARGO TO THE “PHŒNIX.”]

The _Phœnix_ appeared to be crowded with men, as compared with our small
crew of twelve. I learnt afterwards that no less than forty-five men
had been brought down from Yeniseisk to work the barges and get in the
cargo, and that among this big crowd there was a baker, a butcher, and
a man specially told off to attend to the live stock, of which they
had quite a farmyard, on one of the barges. They evidently knew how to
make themselves comfortable while they were about it. I spent an hour
in watching the men working at the cargo, and could not help coming to
the conclusion that with a little less talk a good deal more work could
have been accomplished in the time; there seemed to be too many foremen,
and all seemed to differ in their orders at any critical moment, and
so helped to increase the confusion which was already caused by the
jabbering of the men. It was, however, a picturesque and interesting
sight, this crowd of rough, unkempt men, with their coloured blouses and
their loose trousers, tucked into high boots, reminding one not a little
of bold buccaneers in the good old Adelphi dramas; and although, perhaps,
they did not put quite as much energy into their movements as they might
have done, they made up for it in “effect,” from an artistic point of
view—an effect which was heightened by a quaint sort of chorus they sang
at intervals. They struck me as being a much better-looking lot of men
than an average crowd of the same class in England, and looked well fed
and contented with their lot. A few among them, I was informed, were
exiles who have served their time, but who prefer to continue living in
Siberia, where, from what I can gather, the general opinion is that one
is better off as an exile than as a free man in Russia itself.

We had our first taste of Russian cooking that morning, as we all lunched
on board the _Phœnix_—and a very good lunch it was, although it certainly
was very trying to have to eat without drinking, as is the Russian
custom, and I mentally decided to live _à la Française_ while in Holy
Russia. At the end of the meal a hissing samovar was brought in, tea
was brewed, and a decanter of vodka passed round, and we all agreed that
vodka makes a very good substitute for whiskey, but that weak tea without
milk, drunk boiling hot out of tumblers, would take some getting used
to, as it evidently is an acquired taste, and wants educating up to by a
prolonged stay in Russia. The cabin of the _Phœnix_, though small, was
so clean and cosy that it seemed quite a treat to have a decently served
meal after all the “pigging” we had had to put up with on the _Biscaya_;
it made us almost wish for the time to come when we should transfer our
quarters to her for the river journey. Everything looked as prim as on
a yacht, from the white paint on the deck-house to the deck itself,
which was kept perfectly clean. I feel sure that were the _Phœnix_ to
return once more to her native port of Newcastle, her old owners would
not recognize, in the smart-looking river boat, their quondam steamer,
so thoroughly has she been altered and Russianized. The next day it
was decided to go back to where the other barges had been left by the
_Phœnix_, so our anchors were weighed, and both vessels started.

It took only a few hours to reach Kasanskoi, the next “station,”
which was destined to be our _pied à terre_ for some little time. The
scenery on the way up was tame, and varied but slightly from what I
have previously described; in fact, so flat and uninteresting was it at
times that one could see rolling plains of green for miles and miles
ahead without even a bush to break their monotony. The effect called
“mirage” is very peculiar in these regions. At times distant headlands
appear to go right away up into the sky, and one sees clouds and river
underneath them; sometimes great holes appear, as it were, in the sides
of the hills, and daylight thus seen through them; even on the darkest
and greyest days these effects are noticeable. As the time was now
fully occupied in getting the _Biscaya’s_ cargo safely transferred to
the barges, and as during these operations the _Phœnix_ could be of no
service to us, it was arranged that she should proceed down to the mouth
of the river and wait for the other ship and the tug, which were to have
followed us out from England, and, in the event of their turning up, to
pilot them back to where we were. So we were to have Kasanskoi all to
ourselves for a few days. There being now little of interest to me in the
well-known ship, I decided to explore the neighbouring hills, so would
go ashore by myself in the early morning with my gun and my sketch-book,
and wander about to my heart’s content. There was very little to shoot,
and still less to sketch; nevertheless it was very delightful, after
being cooped up for so many weeks, to find one’s self once more alone
and free as the air on these boundless plains. The bright sunshine, the
familiar flowers, the birds chirping merrily as they flitted from bush to
bush—in fact, the whole scene was the very antithesis of what one would
have expected to see on the bleak tundras of Northern Siberia. It was
almost with a feeling of sadness that one reflected how changed all would
be in a few short weeks hence—for in these high latitudes the seasons
change without any perceptible prelude. At a certain moment of each year,
generally about the end of May, the snow melts away under the influence
of the almost tropical heat of the sun, which now ceases to set; the
earth wakes from her long sleep during the dark months of the Arctic
winter, luxuriant grasses spring up, the flowers appear as if by magic,
hundreds and thousands of migratory birds arrive, the air resounds with
the buzzing of insect life;—it is summer. For about three short months
this wonderful transformation lasts; then gradually the sun disappears,
the long nights return, the piercing north wind commences to blow, and in
a very short time—sometimes in a single night—the ice-king resumes his
sway, the frost-bound earth disappears under a thick pall of snow, and
all is darkness and desolation in the awful silence of the Arctic winter.




CHAPTER V.

KASANSKOI.

    Our Russian customs officer—A shooting-excursion—Visit
    to the settlement of Kasanskoi—The house of a Siberian
    trader—Interesting people—First experience of Russian
    hospitality—The return of the _Phœnix_—Departure of the
    _Biscaya_.


[Illustration: OUR CUSTOM-HOUSE OFFICER.]

We had the Russian custom-house officer quartered on us during the
absence of the _Phœnix_, and a very nice unassuming fellow we all found
him, although we hardly understood a word he said. He was a typical
specimen of a Russian—a great big chap with broad shoulders and long fair
beard. I had heard he was an ardent sportsman, though he had no gun with
him on board; so one evening after supper I thought he might like to come
and have some shooting with me. But how was I to make him understand?
for although I pointed to my guns, he did not seem to comprehend. At
last an idea struck me. I got a piece of paper and drew a duck on it, at
the same time making a sign of shooting with my gun. He guessed at once
what it meant, and agreed to join me. Unfortunately, however, I had only
one fowling-piece with me, and my Winchester was hardly the thing for
wild duck, as he seemed to wish to tell me; but, to his great amusement,
I drew a bear on the paper, and so made an excuse for taking the rifle
also. As may be imagined, we had no occasion to use it. For a wonder, in
a country like this teeming with birds, we only had poor sport in return
for a long and fatiguing walk across miles of swampy ground.

[Illustration: KASANSKOI.]

[Illustration: TRADER’S HOUSE AT KASANSKOI.]

After I had thoroughly explored the adjoining country, one morning I got
out a small steam-launch belonging to the _Phœnix_, and, with a Russian
who spoke a little German as fireman and interpreter, went down the
river as far as the four or five log-houses and huts which constituted
the settlement of Kasanskoi. As at Karaoul, the dogs gave us a hearty
welcome, though, fortunately, they were all chained up this time, as
they looked anything but gentle creatures, and tried hard to get at us.
The largest of the houses was really not a bad-looking sort of place,
certainly far better than one would have expected to find. The proprietor
came out and politely invited us to enter. We accepted his invitation,
and, following him in, found ourselves in a large kind of kitchen, in
which several members of the family were busily engaged in various
household duties. But for the quaint costume of the man, and the fact
that the women were smoking cigarettes, there was nothing particularly
striking about the place. I could not, however, help immediately noticing
how wonderfully clean it was: the walls rivalled the boards of the floor
in whiteness, the table shone like a looking-glass, and everything
showed the handiwork of a careful housewife. The stove was alight, and
the heat was excessive, yet, curiously, there was not the slightest
feeling of ill ventilation. Immediately on entering I noticed (as my
“Murray” told me I should in all Russian dwellings) the inevitable sacred
picture in a corner of the room, and, in accordance with the advice he
gives, I immediately took off my hat, so as to be quite _en règle_.
The Russians, or rather the Northern Siberians, are certainly a most
phlegmatic race, if they are all like the few I have already met. One
would have thought that in this remote place the entrance of a stranger
would have excited just the least little show of interest—but no, they
hardly uttered a word; they just looked up for a second from their work,
and then resumed it without the slightest comment, as if I had been an
ordinary everyday visitor from a neighbouring house. Since they paid so
little attention, I was equally cool, and walked round about the room,
looking at everything as though I had been in a museum; and then got out
my sketch-book, and, sitting down, started a portrait of my host. He
seemed to understand what I wanted of him, and kept as rigid as a statue
while I was doing it.

[Illustration: MINE HOST AT KASANSKOI.]

Even when it was finished, no one evinced the slightest curiosity to see
the result. In any other part of the world one would have been pestered
by people crowding round and all wanting to finger one’s sketch-book;
but here, in this far-away Siberian home, where, to say the least of it,
sketching is not an everyday sight, stolid indifference was stronger
than idle curiosity. I determined to take advantage of it, and, since
my being there did not seem to disturb them a little bit, I got out the
launch, and returned there the next day with my paint-box and largest
sketching-block.

[Illustration: SWEET SEVENTEEN.]

All the people I had seen on the previous afternoon were in the house,
having what evidently was their morning meal. It was a simple and homely
sight, this family gathering round the brightly polished table, with
the glittering samovar towering in the centre. It struck me as being so
interesting that I got a couple of chairs, one to sit on and the other as
an easel, and commenced sketching in the group as rapidly as possible.
Fancy what would have happened if such an event occurred in an English
homestead! Imagine, for instance, a bearded Russian walking coolly in
while breakfast was going on and the whole family present, and, without
saying a word, taking possession of part of the room and commencing to
paint the occupants without even asking permission! In my case, however,
all went as merrily as a wedding-bell: no one interfered with me, and
they were so long discussing their weak tea that, by the time they had
finished, I had managed to get a very fair idea of the _mise en scène_.

[Illustration: A HOME IN NORTHERN SIBERIA: THE MORNING MEAL.

[_To face p. 51._]

With the exception of an hour, when I went down and had my lunch in the
launch, I worked there the whole day as comfortably as if I had been in
my own studio. In spite of their natural indifference, the people, in
their quiet sort of way, evidently wished to help me, and to show me
some little politeness. I noticed that the children were forbidden to
talk loud or even to come anywhere near me, and any one who has had any
experience of sketching in strange places, where, as a rule, the children
worry one even more than the flies, will understand what a boon that was;
while, to cap my adventure with this unique family, during the afternoon
my host came up to me, hat in hand, and, bowing very low, pointed to an
adjoining room. Out of curiosity, I got up to see what was there, when,
to my astonishment, I saw the samovar hissing away, and tea and cakes
waiting for me. This was hospitality indeed, and my only regret was not
being able to express my thanks in Russian, but I fancy they must have
pretty well guessed the meaning of the few bluff words I said to that
effect in English as I drank to the health of my host’s wife in boiling
tea, and very nearly scalded myself. The ice was broken, and they all
laughed very much, for fun is probably very much the same all over the
world. We now became quite friendly, considering I did not understand a
word they said; and I made myself quite at home among them till I had
finished my picture. Before leaving I presented my host with a pencil
sketch of his wife as a souvenir of my visit, and he evidently prized
it very much, for I fancy he intended fixing it up over the religious
picture in the corner.

[Illustration: MATERFAMILIAS.]

The _Phœnix_ returned in about ten days, and, to our great satisfaction,
was accompanied by the two vessels she had gone in search of—the _Thule_,
a small steamer of 400 tons, and the small tug she had towed out from
England. Never before had such a flotilla been seen on the river Yenisei;
the only pity was that there was no one but ourselves to see it. So far
the expedition, with the exception of a few unavoidable delays, had gone
without a hitch. It was quite a treat getting something in the shape of
news, such as it was, and all the papers brought by the _Thule_ were
devoured as eagerly as though they were of the previous day instead of
seven weeks old. The only thing now was to get the cargoes transferred
to the barges as quickly as possible, for the season showed unmistakable
signs of being but a short one this year, and it was imperative that
the two ships should get out of the Kara Sea on their way back to
England before the winter came on. As if to emphasize the admonition the
thermometer had given us, the lovely weather suddenly broke up, and, to
our great astonishment, one morning we woke up to find a couple of inches
of snow on the ground, and everything already looking very winterly,
although it was only September 2. Every one, therefore, set to work with
almost feverish haste, so great a fear does the awful Arctic winter
inspire.

[Illustration: TEA-TIME AT THE MEN’S QUARTERS ON SHORE.]

The scene during this work of transhipping our cargo was one of
surprising novelty. The barges intended for the reception of cattle,
pigs, and poultry were temporarily turned into a sort of floating
farmyard. The Siberians evidently did not intend to forget provision
for the wants of the inner man during their long voyage up the river.
In stowing the cargo, all had to work against time, for every hour of
summer in these regions is of the utmost importance. Here, too, was
already present the inevitable Russian official, personified by one of
the most charming men I ever met, with his two attendant Cossacks, prompt
to scrutinize each package of the _Biscaya’s_ cargo. Indeed, for this
purpose they had been expressly sent down some 1500 miles, on board
the river steamer _Phœnix_, to meet us; such is the vigilance of the
Czar’s officials, even at this remote distance from the central seat of
government.

[Illustration: COSSACKS.]

For us, meantime, who were spectators of the operations, the days were
so much like each other that it was at times difficult to remember what
day of the week it was. It was too cold and wretched to even think of
going ashore, so there was nothing for it but to while away the time as
best we could, and wait events. Every morning the question was asked,
“When shall we get out of this?” for we were all getting heartily sick
of our prolonged inactivity—eight weeks since we left London, and still
a month of dreary river journey before us ere we reach our destination,
Yeniseisk. However, _tout vient à point à qui sait attendre_, and at
last came the welcome news that the ships were at length ready to start
for England, and that we were to transfer ourselves and luggage to the
_Phœnix_ in readiness for the river journey. Still, there was a mingled
feeling of regret as we bid farewell to the good ship _Biscaya_, which
had carried us through so many miles of strange waters, and, in spite of
cramped accommodation, had given us opportunities for many hours of real
pleasure and good fellowship.




CHAPTER VI.

THE RIVER VOYAGE OF THE _PHŒNIX_ UP TO YENISEISK.

    The Yenisei river—Its noble proportions—Scenery along the
    banks—The first tree—Our first mishap—The return of the tug—An
    exciting incident.


[Illustration: A HOUSE-BOAT.]

On September 14 the ocean steamers _Biscaya_ and _Thule_ started on their
return voyage to England, it having been arranged that the tug should
pilot them down to the mouth of the river, and then rejoin us as quickly
as possible. It almost seemed like parting with an old friend, as we got
our last glimpse of the _Biscaya_; for, in spite of her grimy decks and
straitened quarters, we had all of us, somehow, come to look upon her
as a sort of home; and when, after cheering ourselves hoarse, the two
ships at length disappeared behind a distant headland, we realized that
the connecting link with the Old Country was severed, so to speak, and
the magnitude of the journey we had before us seemed to magnify itself.
As a matter of fact, it is only now, on looking back over the six long
weary weeks during which we were slowly making our way against the heavy
stream, through hundreds and hundreds of miles of uninteresting scenery,
and after quite a series of mishaps, that we can fully realize what the
journey was like. For my own part, I should be sorry to undertake it
again. However, to continue my narrative.

[Illustration: THE “PHŒNIX.”

[_To face p. 61._]

The two ships once out of sight, no time was lost, and preparations were
immediately commenced for our speedy departure. The barges had to be
properly stowed, a lot of spare timbers which had been brought down had
to be cut up for the engines, and a host of minor details seen to before
starting on our long journey. Two days were thus spent, and then at last,
exactly a month after our arrival in the river, we made a start with our
heavy load in tow. We made but slow progress, for the stream was strong.
Still, we could not help feeling thankful at moving at all, after our
long period of inactivity.

Although we were now nearly three hundred miles from the mouth of the
river, there was no perceptible difference in its enormous width, which
must nearly average ten miles for at least four hundred miles from the
sea, while in many places it widens out into such enormous expanses of
water that it can only be likened to a continuous series of huge lakes.
As a matter of fact, between Golchika and Karaoul, at a distance of two
hundred miles from the sea, there is one part where for nearly a hundred
miles it is over sixty miles in width, and when there is a gale blowing,
as was the case when we passed up it, the sea is quite as heavy as it
is during a “sou’wester” in the English Channel, the flat character of
the “tundras” (as the vast treeless plains in these regions are called)
rendering the wind exceptionally bleak. Such noble proportions are
thoroughly in keeping with the enormous length of this majestic river,
which, with its important tributaries the Selenga and the Angara, is over
five thousand miles, and takes its rise in Chinese territory, while,
according to the French geographer Reclus, its water-system covers an
enormous area of nearly 2,900,000 square versts (equal to about 1,950,000
English square miles). The largest rivers in Europe dwindle into absolute
insignificance in comparison with it, for the Volga, Danube, Rhone, and
Rhine, if added together, would barely make a Yenisei, while the poor
little Thames would be but as a small muddy brook, even when compared
with one of its least important tributaries—the Kureika, for instance.
Yet on the whole of this vast highway, traversing as it does such a
diversified tract of continent, there are only ten steamers, and these
only kept going through the enterprise of such Siberian magnates as
Siberiakoff, Gadaloff, Boudaresoff, and Kitmanoff. Siberia is still in
its infancy, so the future of its magnificent resources cannot yet be
gauged; still, should they eventually find a market in England through
the medium of the Yenisei and Kara sea-route, it will be solely owing to
British pluck and enterprise, as personified in Captain Wiggins, to whom
is undoubtedly due the honour of being the first to land a British cargo
in the heart of Siberia. Whether this bold and adventurous enterprise be
destined ever to vie with that of the Hudson Bay traders, to which it
can aptly be compared, is scarcely my province to discuss in a narrative
which is purely descriptive; still, one cannot help contemplating it with
pride that the old spirit which existed in our forefathers still remains,
and that, while this exists, England will always retain her position as
the pioneer of commercial enterprise all the world over.

For the next few days after leaving our anchorage, not only was the
journey uninteresting as regards events, but also from a picturesque
point of view. We were still beyond the northern limit of trees, and
the banks of the river, though perhaps presenting some interest to
the geological student, were certainly not strikingly picturesque,
and offered no artistic attractions. This barren appearance, however,
gradually changed, low bushes appeared on the hillsides and gradually
increased in height, till at last, on September 18, we sighted the first
actual tree we had seen since leaving Europe—a solitary and miserable
specimen of the larch species; yet it was a very welcome sight, for it
betokened our approaching return to more temperate latitudes and brighter
scenes. But one must have been in the Arctic regions to understand how
eager one is to get out of their dreary confines. In a very short time,
trees became more and more numerous on either bank—in fact, it almost
seemed as though we had crossed an invisible line beyond which they
could not grow, so sudden was the change once past it. They were still a
species of larch, though so small that some one remarked that they were
not so “larch” (?) as in England. We also saw in the distance several
white foxes along the banks; their being this colour is, as is well
known, a sure sign of approaching winter.

We shortly reached the small church-village of Dudinskoi, the first
station of any importance we had yet come to. We arrived too late to
go on shore, much as we should have liked to; for it appeared, from
all accounts, to be quite a flourishing little place, boasting of a
population consisting of a couple of priests, a police officer, some
exiles, and a number of natives, as well as a rich merchant who owns
nearly all the place. However, we made up our minds to have a look round
the first thing in the morning.

But “man proposes, God disposes.” Daring the night our first mishap
occurred. Without the slightest warning a strong gale sprang up, and
the _Phœnix_ had a very narrow escape of being wrecked. The river being
certainly not less than six miles wide, there was quite a heavy sea on;
our barges were pitched and tossed about like so many corks, and in a
very short time became quite unmanageable, ending by being driven right
up alongside in dangerous proximity to us. The confusion for a time
was awful, and a blinding snowstorm coming on added still more to the
excitement, as it was impossible to see more than a few yards on either
side. Steam, indeed, was quickly got up, and it was immediately decided
to get up the anchors and attempt to run before the gale up-stream.
Before, however, we could get under way, one of the smaller lighters was
swamped, and sank immediately. No one was on board of her at the time,
fortunately. After proceeding some fifteen versts, we found a sheltered
creek, and again anchored.

The gale abated as quickly as it rose, and the next day the weather
was absolutely perfect. All that day we were busy replenishing our
wood-bunkers, for although we had, to all appearances, an almost
inexhaustible supply a couple of days before, it seemed to have
positively melted away once the engines were started. As is the custom
all over Siberia, nothing but wood is burnt, and this is easily
understood when one comes to consider how vast is the forest region of
Siberia, a region only comparable to the backwoods of North America.

At the various small stations, and also here and there along the banks of
the river, are to be found huge piles of wood, placed by the villagers,
ready cut, for the use of the steamers plying between Yeniseisk and the
mouth of the river. This wood is for sale at an average price of one and
a half roubles (a little more than 3_s._ 8_d._) per cubic fathom—(N.B.
the Russian fathom is seven feet, not six feet as in England)—not dear,
considering how much time is saved by finding the wood all ready for use,
as we afterwards discovered when on one or two occasions we ran short of
fuel, and, there being no “station” near, we actually had to burn all our
available spars and other spare timber, and eventually had to send men
ashore to cut down trees—a long and tedious operation. The _Phœnix_ burnt
about fifteen fathoms a day, as I afterwards learnt; so my astonishment
at the quick way the huge piles vanished down the bunker-holes is easily
explained. I hear that some of the other river steamers burn as much as
thirty fathoms in the twenty-four hours.

[Illustration: LOADING WOOD FOR THE “PHŒNIX.”

[_To face p. 66._]

Just as we were finishing loading wood the tug hove in sight, much to our
relief, as she was already overdue, and fear had been expressed for her
safety. She was soon alongside, and we then learnt that she had safely
accomplished her mission of piloting the two ships down to Golchika, but
not, however, without a few mishaps, for she had had a serious fire in
her bunkers, and on one occasion had been aground in a nasty position for
no less than nine hours. However, “all’s well that ends well,” and our
party was now complete again.

The next few days were uneventful. The weather was bitterly cold, and
snow occasionally fell, so the surrounding landscape—if the dreary
expanse of monotonous banks could be so called—looked, if anything, still
more dreary. Then occurred the second incident in the long series of
mishaps which followed us throughout the voyage.

We were busy loading wood one afternoon, when suddenly the captain rushed
on deck, and, in an excited voice, called out that we had sprung a leak!
It may easily be imagined the effect this announcement had on us—it came
like a thunderbolt, so little were we expecting anything unusual. On
further investigation it was found that the water was gaining rapidly,
so without losing a moment all the men were instantly recalled to the
ship and ordered to commence clearing the hold, in order, if possible, to
discover the damage and, if not too late, make it good. The excitement
was great, for, although we were only about two miles from the shore, the
situation was extremely grave, from what we could learn from those who
had been down to see. Most of us, therefore, got our papers and valuables
in readiness in case of emergency. In the mean time the pumps were going,
and steam got ready, so that, in the event of its being necessary, the
ship could be run ashore at a moment’s notice. For some hours no visible
headway was made against the enemy, till towards nine o’clock, after
several hours of hard and persistent work in icy-cold water, the men
were relieved, as it was discovered the water was abating. It afterwards
transpired that, from some unexplained cause, a plate had been started,
and the “list” given to the ship by the loading of the wood on one side
only had caused the inrush of water. One of the engineers was fortunately
soon able to patch it up and obviate any further danger. The prospect of
having, perhaps, to abandon our comfortable quarters was not enticing
while it lasted, and it certainly was with a great sense of relief that
we got under way once more, and then sat down to an extra late dinner,
with a bottle of champagne to commemorate our escape.

For the next twenty-four hours we fortunately were able to proceed
without any special incident. The weather still continued very cold and
wintry, and much snow fell. The few scattered trees on the banks now
grew more closely together, till at length we reached a dense forest,
which we never afterwards entirely lost sight of. Right away southward,
with scarcely a break, I learnt, it stretches to the far-distant Chinese
frontier, some five thousand miles, while to east it is bounded by the
river Lena, which thus gives it an approximate breadth of two thousand
miles—probably the largest tract of forest-land in the world, and, as I
have previously remarked, only comparable to the backwoods of America.
Very depressing was the effect of this continuous wall of trees, in all
the various stages of growth and decay—in some parts the predominance
of firs giving it almost the appearance of a huge plantation of
telegraph-poles. The chief trees appeared to be pine, white birch, lime,
and mountain ash.




CHAPTER VII.

THE RIVER VOYAGE—_continued_.

    An awful fatality—Misfortune follows misfortune—M.
    Sotnikoff—Selivanaka, the settlement of the Skopti—A visit from
    the village “elder.”


[Illustration: DIFFICULT NAVIGATION.]

Our respite from misfortune was destined, unfortunately, to be but very
brief, for on September 23 occurred an awful fatality by which we lost
the commander of the _Phœnix_—Mr. George Lee, agent in Siberia of the
Anglo-Siberian Syndicate. The circumstances of the tragic event in those
far-away wilds were so impressive in their horror that they are as fresh
in my memory as if it had happened only yesterday.

We had been moving slowly but surely, all day, against a strong
head-wind; in the evening, after dinner, we were all seated in the
cabin, smoking, and otherwise passing the time in our usual pleasant
after-dinner fashion, when suddenly we heard a man who was taking
soundings at the bows call out a quick change in the depth of water.
Mr. Lee, who was reading a book, immediately jumped up, and, putting
on his fur coat and cap, hastily went out, exclaiming as he did so
that he “smelt something wrong.” He had only been gone a few minutes,
when we heard loud cries from the deck, the engine stopped, and almost
immediately the captain rushed into the cabin in a frantic state. With
some difficulty we gathered from his gestures that Mr. Lee had fallen
overboard. In less time than it takes to write it we were all outside and
on the upper deck. The excitement was indescribable. It was a pitch-dark
night, and snowing hard; on all sides were men hurrying with lanterns,
while the captain, through his speaking-trumpet, bawled out directions
to the men in tug and barges behind us. For a few minutes, which seemed
ages, we were peering into the intense darkness astern in the hope
of seeing something which would guide us to the whereabouts of the
unfortunate man, but in vain; when, all of a sudden, we heard shouts from
the tug that they had picked him up. Our joy was great, but destined,
unfortunately, to be of short duration. After some little delay, but
really in wonderfully quick time considering, the tug was observed coming
towards us, and soon was alongside. On its deck was a confused group of
men, standing in awed silence, and looking strangely weird through the
driving snow and under the flickering light of a lantern. In their midst,
in a blanket which they were holding by the four corners, was something
dripping wet, human in form. With little difficulty it was got on board
the _Phœnix_, and then we saw it was the lifeless form of our ill-fated
friend, who so few minutes before had been with us in the best of health
and spirits, little dreaming his end was so near. It was a solemn sight,
and brought before us with a power seldom realized that thrilling
sentence, “In the midst of life we are in death.” Although we persevered
for no less than four hours with Dr. Sylvester’s method, and tried every
other known restorative, all was in vain—the unfortunate man never for
one moment showed the least sign of life; so at last we were reluctantly
forced to come to the conclusion that our efforts were futile.

We afterwards learnt how the accident had happened from the only man who
had witnessed it. Mr. Lee, in his excitement to learn the depth of the
water as shown by the sounding-pole, had stood on a log of timber covered
with snow which was lying under the bulwarks, and, leaning over too far,
his foot slipped on the treacherous surface, and he went overboard head
first, so suddenly that he had not time to utter a cry. Considering how
rapid the stream was, and the darkness of the night, the fact of his
body being picked up at all was nothing short of miraculous, for we were
going full speed at the time. Only a few days before, he had been telling
us he could swim like a duck, and that evening during dinner had been
relating some wonderful escapes from death he had had during his life.
We had learnt that his heart was weak, so there can be very little doubt
that the shock of the sudden immersion in the icy-cold water had had an
instantaneously fatal effect, for his features showed no signs of any
death-struggle, but were as calm as in sleep. A long consultation then
took place, with the result that the London agent of the Syndicate took
command of the ship, and she was again started ahead.

This awful event naturally cast a gloom over us all—although, as if
in mockery of worldly griefs, the sun shone out brilliantly the next
morning for the first time since we had left; in fact, it was like spring
again. It was hard to realize that for the remainder of our voyage the
_Phœnix_, so to speak, would be a floating hearse. No end of ghastly
formalities had to be gone through, such as sealing up the dead man’s
effects, having a coffin made by one of the ship’s carpenters, and a heap
of other details, the custom-house officer now proving himself a really
good fellow, and helping us as much as he could; in fact, I don’t know
what we should have done without him, speaking so little Russian as we
all did. We learnt from him that we should have to stop at Turuchansk,
the first important village we came to, and get permission from the
police officer there to take the body on to Yeniseisk, and, as there was
certain to be an inquest, we must make up our minds to some unavoidable
delay. The only thing to be done, therefore, was to get on as quickly as
possible, for we had no time to lose, with winter so close at hand.

But our misfortunes were not yet at an end. A day or so afterwards, owing
to the strong current keeping us back, we ran short of wood when we were
still some distance from the next station; so, in order not to let the
fires out, it was decided (contrary to our usual custom, as we always
anchored at dusk) to proceed all night. It was a nasty wet night, with
a thick mist over everything, so our progress was very uncertain. All
went well till about three o’clock, when suddenly, without the slightest
warning, the water shallowed, and, with a nasty grinding sound which I
shall long remember, the _Phœnix_ ran aground. It was too dark and foggy
at the time to make out where we were, but we evidently were stuck hard
and fast, as was supposed, on a bank in the middle of the river. All
efforts to back her were unsuccessful. The fog lifted shortly after,
and it was then discovered that we had run clean ashore—so close, in
fact, that one could almost have walked off the ship on to the grass.
For several precious hours every possible device was tried in vain, and
at one time things looked decidedly ugly, as we were on a rocky bottom.
Our little tug, however, proved invaluable, for she at length succeeded
in moving our bows, and then, to our great relief, we slid off into
deep water, not without damage, unfortunately, for it was afterwards
discovered that we had broken a blade of the propeller; still, we managed
to get along somehow, in spite of it. It was high time, for we were at
the very end of our supply of wood, and it was only by burning everything
available, even to the hatches and some spare packing-cases we luckily
had on board, that we could reach the next station, where we found wood
in abundance.

We anchored opposite quite a “swagger” house, far and away the best
we had hitherto seen in Siberia. It was two stories high, had carved
window-frames, a bright-green roof, and other attempts at artistic
decoration which one would hardly have expected to find so far away in
Northern Asia. The owner of the place, we learnt, was a rich retired
merchant named Sotnikoff, who had amassed a large fortune by mining
and extensive trading operations. Vegetating in this dead-alive spot
struck me as being a very unambitious ending to a long and successful
life—however, _chacun à son goût_. We went ashore and paid Mr. Sotnikoff
a visit, and were received with the usual hospitality of Russian
people—I mean a regular sort of meal they put before one, generally
consisting of delicious caviare and black bread, fish-pies, cakes, eggs,
etc., washed down with copious draughts of vodka, and followed by the
inevitable samovar. The house was furnished quite in a luxurious fashion,
and the large room we were shown into boasted a really pretty suite of
furniture, and had pictures on the walls. Mr. Sotnikoff, however, in
spite of his great reputed wealth, was dressed in the ordinary costume
of a Russian peasant, and with his long white beard presented quite a
patriarchal appearance. He returned our visit later in the day, and
strongly urged us not even to attempt to reach Yeniseisk with all our
barges so late in the season, winter being so close at hand that the
river might be frozen over at any moment, in which case we risked losing
all our flotilla, if it caught us in any unprotected spot. Our best plan,
he told us, would be to leave one of our least important barges in his
charge till next spring, and proceed with the remainder without losing
a moment, if possible. This advice so corroborated what we had already
learnt that, as a result of a long and serious consultation, one of the
barges was detached and left with him till the spring. We then again
started, hoping that, with our diminished load, we should make better
progress.

The next few days were uneventful; the banks, with their fringe of dense
forest, still continuing in dreary and endless monotony, while overhead
flocks of migratory birds were continually passing us on their way south,
sure and ominous sign of approaching winter. We could not help being
surprised by the number of seagulls we still saw about; in fact, their
name seemed almost a misnomer, so many hundreds of miles were we from the
sea.

The curious huts of the Samoyede natives along the shores now gradually
disappeared, and in their stead appeared other huts somewhat similar
in form, only covered with strips of birch bark instead of skins, and
inhabited by Ostiaks, a race of people not unlike the Samoyedes, but,
from what I hear, certainly much more civilized—though that is not saying
much, for they could not very easily be less so.

On September 30 we passed Selivanaka, a picturesque and flourishing
little settlement, which is entirely inhabited by a portion of the secret
sect called “Skopti,” or “White Doves,” who are perpetually banished from
Russia on account of their peculiar doctrines. I had already read much
about these curious people, and was hoping that we should stop here for
wood, so that I should be able to go ashore and have a look round; but we
were not in need of fuel, and our time was too precious to allow of any
needless delays, so I had to content myself with as good a look at the
settlement and its inhabitants as I could get through my binocular, for,
although a boat containing three men rowed off to us, we did not stop.
However, we had plenty of opportunity later on for a closer inspection of
these men.

It happened this way: The boat returned to the shore, and Selivanaka
was fast disappearing behind us, when we observed another boat rapidly
catching us up, coming along close to the shore. In a very short time
it was abreast of us, and we then saw it was drawn by three dogs, and
contained the same men we had previously seen. They stopped when a little
ahead of us, and, taking their dogs on board, rowed off to us and asked
if we would allow them to tow behind us as far as Turuchansk, some few
versts farther on. The desired permission being given to them, they
shortly after came up on deck, and we therefore had plenty of time to
examine more closely these specimens of one of the most curious sects
in the world. I was lucky enough to get one of them, who turned out to
be the “village elder,” to let me make a careful sketch of him, as he
had a face full of character; during which time I managed, through an
interpreter, to obtain some interesting particulars of these “peculiar
people.” They are all eunuchs, marriage being forbidden among them. The
Holy Virgin and the Christ they worship are appointed by their elders,
and it is said they consider Peter III. as their god, imagining him to
be still living. They are also strict vegetarians and total abstainers,
from which facts one gathers that, taking one consideration with another,
a Skopti’s life is not a happy one.

[Illustration: SELIVANAKA.

[_To face p. 78._]

Afterwards I had a look at their boat, which was towing behind, and I
could not help noticing the ready way in which their dogs made themselves
comfortable during their masters’ absence. The only harness they wear is
a sort of band round the loins, which is connected with the boat by means
of a long cord. Three is the number generally used, and wonderful are the
distances which, I am told, they are able to accomplish—forty and even
fifty versts at a stretch, and against the stream. No whip is ever used,
their master’s voice being quite sufficient to urge them on, for if one
of them flags the others snap at him and make him keep up the pace.




CHAPTER VIII.

TURUCHANSK.

    Visit to the monastery—Werchneimbackskoi—Our first visit from
    official Russia—The police officer of the district—The village
    priest.


[Illustration: THE PRINCIPAL THOROUGHFARE, TURUCHANSK.]

During this time we were steadily advancing, and in the afternoon we came
in sight of the beautiful monastery of Turuchansk, standing up above the
trees like a big white lighthouse, its silvered dome glistening in the
brilliant sunshine. It was our first real glimpse of Holy Russia, and
a welcome sight after our long and wearisome journey. The river still
retained its noble proportions, but was so full of sandbanks that we had
to make a big _détour_ before we could approach the shore. The beach, for
it was nothing less, was covered with boats and quite a crowd of people,
for our arrival was doubtless an event in this quiet place.

As it was uncertain how long we should be staying, we lost no time in
getting ashore and making for the monastery. Its beautiful architecture
offered a curious and striking contrast to the squalid wooden huts
clustered round it, and in its quiet precincts we felt an indefinable
sense of repose, which was very pleasant after the continual noise
on board the _Phœnix_. We had no difficulty whatever in being shown
over the interior of the building, which, I must confess, was somewhat
disappointing, and did not equal the outside effect. As is usual in
the Greek Church, sacred pictures constituted the chief feature, and,
with their gaudy metal appendages, offered a great contrast to the bare
whitewashed walls. As none of us understood Russian, all the interesting
details given us by our guide (a monk, by the way, of most “unmonkish”
appearance) were lost to us. Still, we were much interested in a very
heavy sort of iron jacket and cross, which, we understood him to say,
had been continually worn by some former ultra-religious inhabitant of
the place. For what purpose he had thus afflicted himself we could not
make out, but let us hope it did him a lot of good and brought him to an
early grave, as was doubtless his wish when first donning it.

The few monks live in a wooden building just behind the church, and share
their quarters with the police officer of the district—an arrangement, I
hear, not at all to their taste; still, they have to grin and bear it, as
evidenced by the sentry-box which stood at the very door of the sacred
edifice, and in which a Cossack is stationed when any Government money
is in the district, for it is always kept for safety in the monastery
itself. Our guide, the monk, had very comfortable quarters, and certainly
far more luxurious than one would have expected for a man of his austere
life. Here again Russian hospitality asserted itself. It is certainly a
wonderful trait in the national character; I have never seen it equalled
in any other country. Our genial host insisted on our breaking bread with
him, and produced some delicious caviare and other eatables, which looked
so appetizing we could not refuse.

[Illustration: OUR FIRST VISIT FROM OFFICIAL RUSSIA.

[_To face p. 83._]

[Illustration: WERCHNEIMBACKSKOI.

[_To face p. 83._]

On our return to the ship we learnt that the police officer of the
district had gone on to the next village, some three hundred versts
further up. As by this time the men had finished loading the wood, steam
was got up, and soon we were once again moving onward, and, ere the
moon had risen, peaceful Turuchansk, with its quaint monastery, was far
behind us. In spite of all the adverse prophecies, the weather not only
continued fine, but, during the next few days, became absolutely warm
again. We made capital progress, as we had the wind in our favour, and
reached the village of Werchneimbackskoi even sooner than we had expected.

[Illustration: INTERESTED OBSERVERS.]

Our arrival was hailed by a salute fired from a small cannon on the
hillside, and the villagers crowded forth to have a look at us. It was
a picturesque spot, and looked doubly so in the warm sunshine, the
Oriental-looking little church, with its white walls and green cupolas,
standing out in brilliant relief against the blue sky. In a short time
the police officer arrived, accompanied by his clerk and a couple of
Cossacks, and we thus received our first visit from official Russia. The
Russians, physically, are undoubtedly a fine set of men; nearly all I
have seen so far have been above the average height. This officer topped
them all, for he must have stood at least six feet four inches, and, with
his tall astrachan képi and long fur coat, seemed a huge fellow, a very
good-looking one to boot. Our passports had to be examined here, and a
sort of inquest held on the body of poor Lee. As the proceedings had
no interest for me, not understanding Russian, I went ashore and had a
stroll through the village. It certainly was a great improvement on any
of the others we had yet come to: the houses even had some pretence to
architecture, and looked very pretty with their quaint wooden porticoes.
Dogs, as usual, seemed more numerous than inhabitants; and, had it not
been that I knew how peaceful they are, except among themselves, it would
have required some nerve to pass through them, for the row they made was
simply awful.

[Illustration: THE RUSSIAN POLICE OFFICER.

[_To face p. 84._]

In the evening the police officer dined with us on board the _Phœnix_,
and a very pleasant fellow he seemed. He told us that his jurisdiction
extended over an enormous extent of country, which, on consulting the
map, we found to be no less than _five times_ the size of Great Britain,
extending right away to the Arctic Ocean—an awful and desolate tract,
which he was obliged to visit twice a year. During the winter, he said,
the cold was so intense that at times he had experienced as much as 45
deg. of frost (Réaumur)! We could not help telling him that he looked
remarkably well, in spite of all these hardships.

[Illustration: THE VILLAGE PRIEST.]

The next morning a messenger came to the ship expressly to ask if I would
go ashore and take a sketch of the village priest and his family. This
was rather a compliment, so I could hardly refuse, more especially as
a few minutes later the worthy man himself arrived to show me the way.
(Could it be possible, I thought, that they took in the _Illustrated
London News_ in this far-away Siberian village, and had heard I was on
board?) The priest was a person of remarkable appearance—tall, slim,
and exceedingly good-looking, in an effeminate sort of way—with a long
fair beard and flowing locks, quite a biblical-looking personage, so I
immediately spotted him as a good subject for a sketch. We went up to his
house, and I was presented to Madame, who was most commonplace-looking,
and his children, who were still more so. Fortunately I had brought
my camera with me, so to please him I took them all in a group, and
shuddered to think how it would look when developed. I then asked the
gentleman if I might make a separate study of him; and he not only said
he would be very pleased to let me, but even offered to come on board
to sit for me. So, during the morning, I made a careful pencil study of
him. While doing it, to my astonishment the police officer, who had come
to have a look at what I was doing, asked me if I would like to do him
afterwards. This made it late in the evening before we got away. We,
however, had an extra large amount of wood in the bunkers, so hoped to
make up for lost time.

Nothing of importance occurred till a couple of days later, when there
was a slight outbreak of fire on board, which, fortunately, we were soon
able to extinguish, or it might have developed into a serious affair. As
it was, it detained us some hours. It was caused by some dry wood on the
upper deck igniting through being too close to the base of the funnel
(the upper deck being a Siberian addition to the _Phœnix_). We were now
nearing the famous Kamin Pass, which, with the rapids close to it, is
the crux of the river navigation. It was all along considered doubtful
whether the _Phœnix_ would be able to get her four barges up at one
time, or would have to make several journeys; no such load had ever been
brought up the rapids before.




CHAPTER IX.

THE KAMIN RAPIDS.

    A whole chapter of accidents—First touch of winter—Arrival at
    Yeniseisk.


[Illustration: A VILLAGE BOAT.]

We reached the entrance to the Kamin Pass on October 10, and all of us
got up at six in the morning so as not to miss any of it. I was very
disappointed, for, though the finest sight we had yet seen on the river,
the scenery was not nearly so imposing as I had been led to expect.
Still, I suppose it is very grand for Siberia, which does not abound in
big effects. For about half a mile, high but unpicturesque rocks rose
precipitously from the swirling waters, their summits covered with dense
forests of rigid pine trees, which in themselves took away from the
effect, so regularly did they grow. One of our party said it reminded
him of the Hudson River. With the utmost difficulty the _Phœnix_ managed
to hold her own against the tremendous current, and, with the engines
going at their utmost pressure, after eight hours’ steaming got past the
worst of the rapids, with all her barges in tow—an unprecedented feat in
Yenisei navigation—and this notwithstanding her damaged propeller.

[Illustration: A RIVER PILOT.]

In the mean time the little tug was having a _mauvais quart d’heure_—for,
with her heavy barge, the stream proved too much for her powers; it
was very different work to towing on the Thames—and, as ill-luck would
have it, eventually ended by her being driven ashore some distance away
from us, and in such shallow water that we could not get near enough to
render her any assistance with the _Phœnix_. For two whole days all our
available men were working at her before they were successful in getting
her off. It was dreary work hanging about the deserted ship during this
time, for all the boats were being used, so we could not get ashore,
although an adventurous member of our party tried to fix up a raft, but
was not successful beyond giving us a couple of hours’ hard work in
hauling the confounded logs on board again after his fruitless attempt.
However, at last we got under way again, and arrived at the village of
Worogoro, where we had to stop for wood.

[Illustration: THE RIVER YENESEI AT WOROGORO.

[_To face p. 90._]

The village itself offered little of interest, but I had heard that a
wealthy Tartar lived there, so was looking forward to seeing something
quite startling and Asiatic in appearance, and had my sketch-book ready.
Imagine my disappointment when there came on board what looked more like
a middle-aged English butcher than anything else, even to wearing the
usual sort of blue coat. There was absolutely nothing of the “Tartar”
about him; he looked, on the contrary, a very mild and inoffensive sort
of individual, very unlike what one used to conjure up in one’s mind
in the good old schoolboy days. Close to the village we saw the first
cultivated ground we had seen since leaving Norway, in July.

The next morning an accident happened as they were getting up anchor,
and caused tremendous excitement. By some means the anchor dragged, and
the ship, swinging round with the swift stream, caused the chain to slip
from the capstan, and it ran out with such tremendous velocity that the
capstan was absolutely smashed to pieces. For a moment all the men around
were panic-stricken, and although, to my mind, there was absolutely no
danger, as we were quite close to the shore, I saw the captain and the
custom-house officer devoutly crossing themselves and muttering prayers.
Luckily, it all ended well, for we managed to recover the anchor and
chain by means of the derrick, and the capstan was soon replaced by the
carpenter, and we now began to congratulate ourselves that at last we
should get fairly under way once more.

But we were destined to undergo many more vexatious mishaps before we
reached our journey’s end. The tug, which all along had been unable to
keep up with us, and had proved itself our “old man of the sea,” not
having turned up when we anchored the previous night, and there being
no signs of her, a boatful of wood in charge of three men was sent back
in case she had run short of fuel. To our great annoyance, she did not
turn up in the morning. Hour after hour passed by, and at last it was
decided to leave the barges and run back to see what had happened. It
was certainly most provoking, but the only thing to do. So back we went
at a tremendous pace with the stream, and about ten miles off we came
up with the laggard—anchored, as her fuel had run out. To our great
astonishment we learnt that they had seen nothing of the boat with the
wood we had sent them; it must, then, have passed them during the night,
and they informed us their anchor light had gone out at one moment. So
here was another delay, as we had now to go in search of this boat. Off
we started, and another seven miles or so farther down we at last sighted
it—much to our relief, for we were almost beginning to fear something had
happened. The men, as ill-luck would have it, had evidently managed to
pass the tug during the night at the exact moment when its lantern went
out. The day was nearly gone by the time we got back to the barges again.
Still, as there was a moon rising, it was decided to proceed without
further delay.

The stream during the next few days was so swift that, with our broken
propeller, we barely did two versts an hour; it was little better than
standing still, and the vibration all over the ship was so great that it
was impossible to read with comfort, still less to attempt to sketch or
write. However, we were thankful to be making any headway at all, and to
be able to pass a short time without any more mishaps. But our respite
was not for long. We managed to run short of wood at some distance from
the next “station,” and, as we had on a previous similar occasion burnt
up all our available spare timber, we had to stop and send the men ashore
to cut down some trees. The water was so deep that, although the _Phœnix_
was drawing eight feet, she was able to go so close in to the shore that
we could put out a plank from her deck and walk off on to _terra firma_.
Two of us took advantage of the opportunity to stretch our legs, and,
taking our rifles, started on a ramble. The forest grew right down to
the river’s bank, and was almost impenetrable; dense underwood and huge
fallen trees barred one’s passage at every step, as though to warn one
from endeavouring to penetrate too far into its gloomy recesses, while
through the gaunt fir trees the rushing wind seemed to moan and sob as
though at the approach of winter. It was a dreary, uncanny sort of place,
and thoroughly realized my idea of the wilds of Siberia—so much so, in
fact, that I felt glad to get out of its mysterious twilight into the
broad daylight again.

Our custom-house officer and the first engineer the next morning took
their guns and started off in search of game; they arranged to be back
in a couple of hours, in readiness for our departure, but when we were
ready to start they had not reappeared. Two hours more passed, and still
no signs of them. We began to get anxious, and kept the steam-whistle
going incessantly, in case they did not know the time. When at last they
were quite four hours late, we could come to no other conclusion but
that they had lost themselves, or that something had happened, so we
immediately organized search-parties, and in a few minutes a dozen of us,
fully armed, started off in different directions into the forest. It was
a difficult task we had before us, and not unlike the proverbial “looking
for a needle in a bundle of hay,” as no one had the slightest idea which
way the two men had taken. It was arranged that, as soon as they were
found (for we seemed to have no doubt about it), the steam-whistle should
be sounded four times as a signal to the other parties to return to the
ship. Our satisfaction may easily be imagined when, half an hour or so
afterwards, we heard the welcome sound which announced that what might
have been yet another serious affair had come to a safe conclusion.

On getting back, we saw the two men in a state of utter exhaustion; in
fact, if one of the party who had found them had not had the forethought
to take his flask of brandy with him, they would never have been able
to get back without being carried, as they were dead-beat, having had
nothing to eat that morning. They told us that they had come across a
bear’s trail, and in their excitement following it lost their way, and
although they could hear the steam-whistle in the distance they could not
localize the sound, and were actually going away rather than to it, as it
appeared. They said they were on the point of giving in when they were
found, for night was coming on, and they were famished with hunger and
cold. We quite believed them, for they presented a pitiable appearance.
They only had three damp matches and a few cartridges left, and had
not even a compass to guide them. This bear-hunting experience will,
therefore, probably teach them a lifelong lesson—not to venture into a
dense and almost impassable forest, without a compass and taking one’s
bearings on it beforehand. However, fortunately, as it happened, it was a
case of “all’s well that ends well,” although another day had been lost.

We were now getting well within touch of our destination, and on arrival
at the village of Nasymovo, some eighty miles from Yeniseisk, sent a
messenger on ahead with letters and telegrams with reference to Mr. Lee’s
death. He was a veritable messenger of death, and we felt what an awful
shock it would be for his family. Still, it was better they should know
of it before we arrived. This village, the last of importance we should
stop at, was quite a big place, the principal street certainly being
nearly a mile in length. There were several really good shops, in one of
which, among a host of miscellaneous articles displayed, was a package
of “Brook’s Crochet Cotton.” It was quite refreshing to see the English
label.

That evening we had our first touch of real cold, the thermometer going
down to 20° Fahr.—quite a respectable commencement, although none of our
Russians seemed to think much of it. We now proceeded more rapidly, as
the current was less swift, and we were looking forward to the speedy
termination of the most tedious journey any of us had ever made. We
began to count the hours which now separated us from civilization, for
the little town which we were now approaching seemed a sort of El Dorado
after our cramped shipboard quarters. No further incident occurred, and
at eight o’clock in the evening of Saturday, October 25, we anchored
off Yeniseisk, the goal which we had so long been striving to reach,
and which we had reached, in spite of all adverse prophecies, thus
accomplishing the feat of landing an important cargo of British goods in
the very heart of Siberia.

CHAPTER X.

THE CITY OF YENISEISK.

    Custom-house officials—Novel sights in market-place
    and streets—My lodgings—Siberian idea of “board and
    lodging”—Society in Yeniseisk—A gentleman criminal exile.


[Illustration: YENISEISK.]

Very few Englishmen have any real knowledge of Siberia. To most of them
its name raises a dismal vision of ice-bound wastes and wretched exiles
passing their lives in hopeless and cheerless misery. Little do they
know that, far away in the very heart of Asia, there exists civilization
equal to what is to be found in any part of Europe. But this is actually
the case, and when, sitting after dinner smoking a cigarette, in a
luxuriously furnished and delightfully warm apartment, surrounded by
rare tropical plants and with appointments not to be excelled in Paris,
it was hard to realize how far one was from Europe, or that outside
the cold was 28 deg. below zero (Réaumur), and that it was so short a
distance from the wild uninhabited regions that had to be traversed
before reaching this far-away Siberian city.

I shall never forget my impressions when, after the fourteen long dreary
weeks passed in the Arctic Ocean and in river navigation, we at last
anchored off Yeniseisk. It was towards eight o’clock, a cold wintry
evening, though October was not yet passed. The moon was just rising, and
in the still evening air the effect was almost that of a huge panorama:
against the southern sky the many churches and the strange-looking wooden
buildings of the Asiatic city stood out in sharply defined silhouettes,
relieved here and there by the lights in the windows of the houses facing
the river, while along the banks we could just discern, in the increasing
twilight, dark masses of people hurrying down to greet us on hearing the
sound of our steam-whistle, which was being vigorously blown to announce
our arrival. The church bells began ringing as we let go our anchors, and
immediately all the Russians who were crowded on the upper deck, from the
captain downwards, uncovered their heads, and, bowing devoutly, crossed
themselves again and again as they murmured a prayer of thanksgiving for
their safe return.

It was a strange and weird sight, and made me involuntarily rub my eyes,
to ascertain if I were really awake, and all this not a dream—the long
and wearisome journey at length at an end—the goal attained. There was,
however, little opportunity for soliloquizing, for within a very short
space of time after the stoppage of our engines we were boarded and
taken possession of by the inevitable custom-house officers and their
assistants, and the voyage of the _Phœnix_, successfully accomplished,
was a thing of the past. Much as we all naturally desired immediately to
go on shore, we could not do so, for we were courteously though firmly
informed that until our baggage had been examined none of us could leave
the ship.

The next day was Sunday, and we were all awakened early by the sound of
many church bells—not the familiar notes one knows so well in the old
country, but a curious sort of jangle, without any attempt at harmony, in
a low key, which reminded one of the noise produced by a child strumming
with two fingers on the bass of a piano very much out of tune. Sleep
after this was impossible, and we were all of us soon on deck, anxious
to get a glimpse of Yeniseisk by daylight. The effect, though of course
not so strange as when seen by moonlight, was undoubtedly imposing, and
seen from the Yenisei the city certainly presents a grand appearance.
No less than three fine churches stand in close proximity to each
other facing the river, each one vying with the others in architectural
pretensions, while all along the road facing the water are houses, or,
rather, large villas, which remind one much of the South of France,
except that they are of stucco instead of marble. Snow had fallen during
the night, and, though the temperature was not cold, the aspect in the
bright morning sunshine was decidedly wintry in effect. Shortly after
breakfast the custom-house people (our old friend Bouldakoff included)
started examining our baggage. From what I had always heard about
Russian officials, I quite expected to have a _mauvais quart d’heure_,
considering my large store of ammunition and my big cases of tinned
provisions for my long land journey. To my astonishment, however, I
was treated with a politeness and a courtesy which, in all my varied
experience of this most irksome branch of Government officialism, has
never been equalled. I could not help mentally contrasting it with what
I have often experienced at Charing Cross, Newhaven, or Paris. In a very
short time, my numerous bags, valises, and cases were disposed of, and I
was free to land whenever I chose. Out of all my really large quantity of
odds and ends, so to speak, I eventually only had to pay a slight duty on
my photographic apparatus and films. After this, as you may imagine, we
were all of us soon on shore, and exploring the place.

[Illustration: PEASANT WOMAN.]

On closer inspection, Yeniseisk does not, like many foreign cities,
lose in interest, for the streets are wide, and there are many fine
buildings in them which would compare well with those of most Western
towns. Novel and interesting sights were to be met with at every step.
Strange-looking vehicles crowded the spacious market-place, surrounded by
motley crowds of noisy peasants, who, however, were far too occupied with
their bargaining to notice me by more than a passing glance, in spite
of my costume, which, to say the least of it, must have been a novelty
to most of them. I could not help picturing to myself the probable
effect a Russian tourist would produce were he to turn up suddenly in an
English provincial town on market-day and walk about among the crowd of
rough country folk. He would possibly get more than a passing glance,
and, doubtless, be glad when he had got out of the place. What struck
me most at first sight in Yeniseisk was, to all outward appearance, the
entire absence of shops, which, as a rule, give so much local colouring
and life to a place. Of course there are shops, but from the outside
they are unrecognizable, as no goods are displayed in the windows, and
only a name-board betokens their existence. This, I hear, is the custom
throughout Northern Siberia, and it is easily understood, when one
considers that in all the houses there are double, and in some cases even
treble, windows, to keep out the intense cold during the winter, and that
even in spite of these precautions the innermost windows are thickly
coated with ice, notwithstanding the high temperature of the rooms!

[Illustration: IN THE MARKET PLACE. YENISEISK.

[_To face p. 101._]

I was much surprised to learn that there was no hotel in Yeniseisk—a
fact, doubtless, to be accounted for by reason of the few travellers
who visit this out-of-the-way place, those having occasion to do so
probably staying with friends or taking lodgings. Perhaps, however, with
the possible annual advent of English tourists by the Kara Sea route,
some enterprising Yeniseisk citizen will find it a profitable venture to
start one (on English lines, it is to be hoped). Fortunately, lodgings
were readily to be got—and cheap into the bargain; so, with the aid of
an interpreter, I was soon snugly quartered in two rooms, which for
comfort and warmth left nothing to be desired, though there might perhaps
have been a little more furniture, and also washing accommodation; but
that, however, was a detail. I have stayed in many worse rooms when
on sketching tours in France. “Board and lodging” I arranged for,
but I afterwards discovered that, although they had agreed to provide
“everything,” I was expected to find such “extras” as bedding, sheets,
blankets, towels, tea, sugar, milk, butter, eggs, and candles, if I
desired such luxuries. When I expressed my surprise to the interpreter,
I was informed that such is the Russian custom. I asked what “board and
lodging” really meant, then; but he was unable to explain. As he was a
Russian himself, he probably thought what strange ideas Englishmen have!
However, in spite of this slight inconvenience, I managed to settle down
comfortably in a very short time, and found the people I was lodging
with very obliging, and ready to do their best to supply my wants when I
tried to express them in the few words of Russian I had managed to pick
up while on board the _Phœnix_. It was the commencement of the “season”
when we arrived at Yeniseisk, and the town was full; for, with the
advent of winter, the neighbouring gold-mines are deserted, and the rich
owners return to their palatial town residences, so the place presents a
much more animated appearance than it does during the summer, when the
greater portion of the male inhabitants are absent, and the streets look
comparatively empty.

The great industry of Yeniseisk is, of course, centred in its
gold-fields, which were once among the most important of Siberia, but
are now not so prolific as formerly. Everybody in the town has a direct
or indirect interest in them, this being easily accounted for—the money
made in them being all, as a rule, spent in Yeniseisk, so all the local
trades profit by it. No less than eight thousand men are annually
employed in the different workings—many coming from long distances to get
employment—the pay, as a rule, being exceptionally good, and all their
food found them. Some of the wealthiest of the mine-owners employ as many
as six hundred men, and have a hospital and medical staff permanently
attached to the works. The alluvial gold-mines of the Yeniseisk district
have been worked since 1839. The quartz working has only recently
been commenced, and it promises very great results. Better skill and
appliances than are at present available are, however, needed, I learn.

During the winter months Yeniseisk is well provided with amusement. There
is a capital club-house, which would pass muster anywhere, to which
is attached a theatre and a ball-room, with a delightful “floor,” and
performances or dances take place two or three times a week. I shall
long remember my first evening at Yeniseisk, when I was taken to see the
club; there was a dance on, and in the large, brilliantly lighted rooms,
with an excellent band playing a familiar waltz, it was hard to believe
one’s self nearly two thousand miles from a railroad, and in the very
heart of Asia. Society in Yeniseisk, of course, consists principally
of the wealthy mine-owners, or merchants, and their families, and the
Government officials and theirs. These are sufficient pretty well to fill
the club on big dance nights. Exiles, who naturally form an important
contingent, are only allowed to enter subject to certain restrictions.
For instance, the criminal ones are only permitted to come to the
performances in the theatre, and are obliged to leave immediately after;
while the political ones are permitted to remain after the performance,
but on no account to dance. I learnt all this on inquiry, for to a casual
observer nothing is noticeable of these arrangements, as the exiles fall
in with them without demur, and everything is conducted in a manner
which certainly reflects great credit on the management, and could not
be excelled in any European club of the kind. Still, in spite of all
this, I could not help feeling that Yeniseisk is a very democratic place.
Everybody somehow seems to think himself as good as anybody else, and at
a performance, during the _entr’acte_, when every one walks about, you
become quite tired of the number of people who expect you to shake hands
with them, from the rich mine-owner to the discharged convicted forger,
in Siberia “for life.”

One of these latter gentlemen, a well-dressed man (who, I afterwards
learnt, had not only committed a big forgery, but also several minor
felonies, for which he would probably have been “doing” fifteen years in
England), introduced himself to me one day, and in very good French,
but with no end of “swagger,” asked me how I liked Yeniseisk, and on
my replying that I liked it very much and thought it very pretty, he
simply stared at me with amazement for a moment, and then said, “You have
evidently not yet seen Moscow or St. Petersburg, or you would not think
so. All I can say is, that it is a positive disgrace to send a gentleman
like me to such a hole!” I had the greatest difficulty in preventing
myself from telling him that he might consider himself lucky he had not
committed the same offences in England, or he would probably be in a very
different sort of “hole,” as he called it.




CHAPTER XI.

THE CITY OF YENISEISK—_continued_.

    A visit to the prison—First impressions of the Siberian system.


[Illustration: A PRISON BEAUTY.]

I was naturally anxious to see something of the prison system here. On
hearing of my desire, the governor of Yeniseisk, with whom I had got on
very friendly terms, courteously offered not only to let me accompany him
on one of his weekly inspections of the prison, but also to let me make
some sketches of what I should see, if I so desired. I naturally jumped
at the offer, and on the appointed day I was punctual to the appointment,
and we drove together in his sledge. It was an intensely cold day; in
fact, the coldest I had yet experienced, there being no less than 28 deg.
of frost (Réaumur), so one simply had to bury one’s self in one’s furs,
and avoid talking as much as possible.

[Illustration: THE GOVERNOR VISITING THE MEN’S PRISON, YENISEISK.

[_To face p. 109._]

The building, which is on the outskirts of the town, offers nothing of
interest from the outside, being an ordinary two-story brick building,
looking much like most prisons anywhere. It is placed in close proximity
to the barracks, so that in case of need military assistance is readily
available. At the gates of the courtyard, where a sentinel was stationed,
we were received by the _personnel_ of the establishment—the director of
the prison, a tall, thin, military-looking man in a shabby uniform, with
a long sword by his side, and a huge astrachan _képi_ on his head—and
five undersized little jailers, who were armed with cutlasses and big
revolvers, which looked much too large for them. I learnt afterwards that
the director was a Polish exile, who had been sent to Siberia after the
last insurrection in Poland, and, at the expiration of his sentence, had
elected to remain in Siberia as the director of the criminal prison of
Yeniseisk. We then entered the building. Once inside the heavy iron-bound
doors, the temperature was delightfully warm as compared with outside,
and, as is usual in Siberia, an even heat everywhere, on the stone
staircases, in the corridors, and in the rooms. So far as warmth is
concerned, the prisoners certainly have nothing to complain of. After
considerable unlocking of big padlocks and removing ponderous bars,
we entered the portion of the prison occupied by men undergoing long
sentences for felony and other offences. It was a big sort of vaulted
hall, dimly lighted by a few heavily grated windows on one side. Under
the windows the whole length of the room was a very wide sort of sloping
shelf, which serves as a sleeping-place; and ranged against this shelf,
shoulder to shoulder, stood a long line of prisoners in the usual prison
garb of Siberia. On our entry, they all as with one voice called out,
in a deep guttural bass tone, the word “_Sdrasteté!_” (Good day), to
which the governor replied by a military salute. As we walked slowly
up the line I had a good opportunity of a near inspection of the most
awful-looking crowd of ruffians I have ever seen. Perhaps the ill-fitting
garment they wore added to the effect; still, with very few exceptions,
vice was written on their faces, and I was not astonished to learn that
most of them were old criminals, and had been there many years. This hall
led into another, and yet another, with the same long lines of unkempt
ruffians. Somehow, on looking at them, I could not help thinking of the
awful photographs one sees outside the Morgue in Paris. I remarked to the
governor what a dreadful thing it must be for a young man for a first
and perhaps trivial offence to be thrown among such a crowd of rascals,
who have nothing to do all day but sleep and eat, and who are under no
supervision whatever except that of an occasional visit from one of the
insignificant jailers. He agreed with me that the system is a wrong one,
but, said he, “Que voulez-vous? Il n’y a pas de place pour les caser tous
seuls.” My astonishment was that five such little warders could keep such
a crowd in order; but doubtless the knowledge of the close proximity of
the barracks has a wholesome effect.

In the corner of each hall, close up by the ceiling, was the
indispensable sacred picture, or _ikon_; looking strangely incongruous
in such foul surroundings. Still, even in this dismal place there was
a touch of humour. As we passed slowly through, one miserable wretch
complained to the governor that his coat did not fit; to which the
governor very neatly replied that he could do nothing in the matter. If
people wanted their clothes to fit they should not come there!

We then visited the murderers’ department, which was in the upper story.
There were no less than thirty men and women waiting their trial on this
charge. Capital punishment does not exist in Russia, so the worst these
prisoners can expect is hard labour at the mines for a certain number of
years, after which they are free to live in Siberia, but not to return
to Russia. In this portion of the prison the rooms were smaller, and
only contained, at the most, a dozen men in each. All these prisoners,
though as yet untried, were, without exception, in irons. Several of the
most desperate characters were in solitary confinement. In one of the
“solitary” cells was a tall, good-looking man, who had murdered an old
woman—a foul and brutal murder, I heard, and committed for the sake of a
few roubles only. He complained bitterly about being shut up all alone,
as, he said, he had done “nothing.”

[Illustration: THE MURDERERS’ DEPARTMENT, YENISEISK PRISON.]

“How nothing?” said the governor; for the man had been taken red-handed,
and, in fact, had never denied his guilt.

“It was _only a woman_ I killed!” was the whining reply, and then he
looked astonished at the expression of disgust on our faces on hearing
this little speech.

There is no doubt about it that the solitary-confinement system is the
one with the most terror in it. I could not help trying to imagine
the feelings of the caged ruffian as he saw the door shut, and heard
the heavy bars drawn and the massive padlock replaced—very different,
probably, to those of the rascals in the large hall below, who doubtless,
as soon as we were out of hearing, recommenced their pandemonium.

The women’s prison, which we afterwards visited, struck me as being a
curious sight, and reminded me not a little of Dickens’s description of
the old “Fleet” or “Marshalsea” prisons. The inmates seemed free to do
what they pleased—of course, with the exception of leaving the place—and
the effect on entering was most extraordinary. The room was full of
steam, for it was “washing day,” I was informed, and overhead was quite a
network of ropes with wet clothes on them, hung up to dry. Dirty, unkempt
children crowded round us as we entered, while, through an open door
leading to an adjoining department, appeared a lot of semi-clad females,
who regarded us with a curiosity devoid of all modesty. There was here
none of the respect which we were shown in the men’s quarters, for these
sullen-looking, half-naked women evidently looked upon our visit as an
unwarrantable intrusion on their privacy.

As a result of my very interesting morning, I could not help coming to
the conclusion that, at any rate as far as I could judge, the criminals
of Siberia have little to complain of. They pass their forced seclusion
in absolute idleness, if they so wish, for the work they do, if any, is
voluntary—eating and sleeping, they while away the time as best they
can, like so many caged beasts.

[_To face p. 113._]

On another occasion I had an opportunity of seeing a batch of criminal
prisoners start for Krasnoiarsk, where they were being sent for trial.
They were all assembled in the hall of the Palais de Justice, and a
strange crowd they looked, sitting along the wall on a bench, dressed
in their drab kaftans, which serve them as overcoats. Round about
lolled the guard which was to escort them half-way to Krasnoiarsk,
half a dozen undersized soldiers (not “Cossacks,” as they are often
erroneously described), with rifles and fixed bayonets. All were well
wrapped up for the journey, with huge woollen comforters round their
necks, black gloves, and felt boots on. I had no difficulty in getting
them to remain still while I made a sketch, for they seemed readily to
understand what I wanted, even to the prisoners. As usual, when I had
finished, no one evinced the slightest curiosity to see the result. A few
minutes afterwards they started, under the command of a non-commissioned
officer. And a curious procession it was, for none of the prisoners
seemed to feel their position, and walked just as they pleased. I could
not help thinking that the soldiers had the worst of it, burdened as they
were with their heavy rifles, ammunition, and accoutrements, while the
prisoners had absolutely nothing to carry. The soldiers from Yeniseisk
only go half-way, when they meet a convoy from Krasnoiarsk, and exchange
prisoners. The journey takes about a week, as they only travel about
fifty versts a day, and only during the daylight.

There is no prison for “political exiles” in Yeniseisk. Most of this
class of _déportés_ who are living in the town have already served their
term of punishment elsewhere, and have elected to remain in Siberia,
where they probably find the life not half so bad as it is painted; or,
as is often the case, were banished “for life” from Russia, and condemned
to pass the remainder of their days in Yeniseisk or some other town or
village.

In the case of a well-connected and educated man being sent from, say,
Moscow or St. Petersburg, or some other important city in Russia, for a
long period to some remote Siberian village, the punishment must be a
severe one. From the little I have seen of these villages on our way up
the river, I can imagine no fate more dreadful than to be shut up alone
in one of them, among a lot of unsympathetic and ignorant peasants, with
no books to read, and entirely out of touch and hearing of the civilized
world. Better almost to be buried alive! When, however, instead of to an
out-of-the-way village, he is consigned to a biggish town like Yeniseisk
or Krasnoiarsk, his fate is certainly not so hard. He is allowed to live
how and where he pleases; if he has money of his own he is permitted to
receive it; and if he is a sociable man he will soon find that he is
not treated as an outcast, even by the officials, who, at any rate at
Yeniseisk, are, I hear, the very embodiment of courtesy and politeness,
though I believe it to be the same all over Siberia; and he will probably
soon settle down to his new life, and, as is often the case when the
sentence is not a “life” one, he will eventually decide to remain in a
country which, though doubtless not all _couleur de rose_, is certainly
not all black.

Still, there are many fine fellows whose fiery spirits not even exile
to Siberia can tame, and who are only biding their time to return to
Russia and start a fresh struggle for freedom—with possibly (or rather,
probably) the same, or a worse, result to themselves.

There are a few of this sort here. One of them, M. X., an evidently
well-educated man of about forty, was sent to Siberia for five years,
two out of which he passed in a village, the rest in Yeniseisk. His time
is up soon, when he will be allowed to return to Russia again, but not
to live in a University town. His wife accompanied him into exile. I met
them out one evening at a friend’s house, and had a long and interesting
talk with both of them in French, as I was anxious to learn something of
his experiences. I could not help remarking to Madame that after what her
husband had undergone he would, doubtless, on his return to Russia, not
meddle with politics again. To my astonishment, she replied—

“_Nisnaia?_” (Who can tell?)

“What!” said I, “is not once sufficient to come to Siberia?”

But she shook her head, and answered, “It is very difficult to remain
silent when one sees the state of things in Russia, and one knows how
very different it is in other countries. If no one takes the initiative,
it will never be changed.”

We were on delicate ground, so I thought it best to change the subject,
as one can never tell who may be listening. Moreover, politics are not in
my line. However, I managed later on to have a further chat with M. X. on
the subject, and he corroborated the words of his wife, in spite of my
asking him if he had not had enough of it already in Siberia, for if he
were again caught tripping he would doubtless not get off so easily, but,
in all probability, be sent to the mines. “_Surovno!_” (It is all the
same to me!) was his characteristic reply. The idea that they are wasting
their lives on a cause which is not yet nearly ripe for solution, and
which, for the moment, only time can help, never seems to occur to these
men, who plod away cheerfully into Siberia with the firm conviction that
they are making martyrs of themselves in the cause of liberty, whereas,
in reality, they are only helping to colonize this vast continent.




CHAPTER XII.

YENISEISK—_continued_.

    The hospital—Siberian houses—Their comfort—The streets of the
    city.


[Illustration: STREET SCENE, YENISEISK.]

A few days after, I received an invitation to visit the hospital, and, as
I heard it was a very interesting sight, I eagerly availed myself of it.
The house doctor, an amiable old gentleman, who spoke German fluently,
showed me over the place, and evidently took a great pride in it,
although he informed me it was very old and was to be shortly replaced by
a new building. The Yeniseisk sick-list was, unfortunately, very large at
the time of my visit.

On entering the principal ward, every bed of which was occupied, I was
much struck with the curious effect before me; it looked as if the place
had been prematurely decorated for Christmas. Everywhere pine saplings
were placed—between the beds and along the walls—reaching from the ground
to the ceiling. On asking the reason, I was informed that it was to
purify the air. It certainly wanted it, for the atmosphere was simply
stifling. An English doctor would have stood aghast at the temperature.
There was no attempt whatever at ventilation, and the triple windows were
all hermetically sealed. Only a Russian could have lived in it, and all
the patients seemed comfortable enough.

[Illustration: A WATER-CARRIER.]

The fire brigade at Yeniseisk, as is usual in all Siberian towns—where
the danger is so great in consequence of the many wooden houses—is
remarkably well organized. In case of need, the numerous water-carriers
of the town are bound to give their services and provide horses and
water-carts; while in the tower over the fire-station is always a
watchman, whose sole duty is to look out for the enemy, and to give
warning of any outbreak by means of a big alarm-bell fixed on the upper
platform.

[_To face p. 118._]

[Illustration: A SWELL.]

What, I fancy, astonishes an Englishman most in Siberia for the first
time, is the wonderful temperature he finds inside all the houses, from
the richest to the poorest—a temperature so equable as to permit of the
rarest tropical plants being cultivated with the greatest success. I may
say, in fact, that many of the houses of the rich mine-owners present
the appearance of conservatories, so crowded are they with exotics of
all sorts, from climbing plants trained to grow round the doors to
huge palms or plantains, and all in the most perfect condition. An
Englishman’s surprise is, therefore, comprehensible. He has heard of
the frightful cold of the Siberian winter, so arrives in the country
duly armed against it according to English ideas. To his astonishment he
finds that, when the thermometer in the street registers 40 deg. of frost
(Réaumur) the temperature of his room is still as genial as though it
were spring, although there is no stove visible. His thick flannel shirts
are naturally very much too warm; he only requires one thin blanket on
his bed; and, when he goes out into the open air, his _dacha_ is amply
sufficient to keep out the cold. That most complete device for heating
a house that was ever imagined, the Russian stove, robs, therefore,
the Siberian winter of many of its terrors, and makes a visit to this
interesting and little-known country pleasant even during the coldest
period of the year.

The High Street of Yeniseisk is not unpicturesque; and the importance of
many of the buildings is enough to upset all the previously conceived
ideas of Siberian towns. It would astonish most Europeans if they could
see the stately mansions owned by some of the millionaire mine-owners
and rich exiles; these houses look as if they had been transplanted from
the Champs Elysées or the Bois de Boulogne, and in the interior are to
be found luxuries with which Paris, rather than Siberia, is generally
associated. In my sketch I have, unfortunately, been unable to give any
of these palatial residences, as I wanted to show the general effect
of the town, with the schools, fire-towers, one of the many churches,
and the inevitable telegraph-poles. The two Collegiate schools—one for
boys, the other for girls—were founded by one of the merchant princes of
the town—Mr. Kitmanoff. They are built in a style which would mark them
as striking-looking buildings in any town in the world. They contain a
fine laboratory of physical science, well supplied with apparatus, and a
drawing-class room, provided with plaster casts and geometrical models;
the walls of the rooms and corridors are hung with maps, drawings, and
diagrams useful for teaching, and the seats and desks are of the most
approved design for schools. There are several European professors
of competent attainments in this excellent educational institution.
Yeniseisk, though only a place of ten or twelve thousand inhabitants, is
quite a model abode of civilization.

[Illustration: THE TWO COLLEGIATE SCHOOLS, YENISEISK.

[_To face p. 120._]

[Illustration: LIFE IN SIBERIA: AN AFTERNOON DRIVE, YENISEISK.

[_To face p. 121._]

It is worth while to see the ladies of fashionable society going out for
an afternoon drive at Yeniseisk. When the temperature is not too low,
say, 15 deg. below zero (Réaumur), one sees many smart sledges about.
Four o’clock in the afternoon is the favourite time for driving, and one
can then see horses as fine as those of any private carriages in London.
The fair occupants of the sledges are, as a rule, too much wrapped up in
furs to be seen to advantage, and, as the “grand chic” is to tear along
at top speed, but a fleeting vision of beauty is all that is generally
obtained, and before you have time almost to recognize who is in the
sledge it is already far away.

The city of Yeniseisk at this moment is, of course, of great interest to
Englishmen, on account of the scheme for sea traffic between England and
the Yenisei—which, if it prove successful, will probably go a long way
towards making the fortune of the smart little town—and, if the canal is
ever finished which the Government is constructing to connect Yeniseisk
with Tomsk, there will exist, by means of the Volga, Obi, Yenisei,
Irtish, Angara, and Amoor Rivers, one of the longest water highways of
the world, and Chinese and Central Asian goods will be brought direct
to the railroad at Tiumen, and thus to the gates of Europe, without
transhipment.




CHAPTER XIII.

FROM YENISEISK TO KRASNOIARSK.

    My first experience of sledging—A delightful
    adventure—Krasnoiarsk—The market-place—The High Street.


[Illustration: READY TO START.]

If asked which place I should prefer, Krasnoiarsk or London, to pass the
winter in, I should, without hesitation, give the preference to this
picturesque Siberian town, with its bright blue sky and exhilarating
atmosphere, its gay and interesting society, and many festivities during
the Christmas season. I do not think there was ever a country less known
or more maligned than Siberia. I found this out more and more every day;
but I formed that opinion from the time I landed, after my voyage through
the Arctic Seas, and I have not had occasion to alter it, nor am I likely
to do so.

In my last chapter I endeavoured to give you a description of Yeniseisk,
the first Siberian town of any importance I had then reached, and where
I managed to spend five of the pleasantest weeks imaginable among some of
the most hospitable people I ever had the good fortune to meet. Far-away
Yeniseisk will long remain graven on my memory, not only on account of
its being the long-looked-for goal of the most eventful voyage I ever
made in my life, but also as recalling many delightful hours and novel
experiences.

The journey by sledge from Yeniseisk to Krasnoiarsk, a distance of 331
versts, if one travels day and night, takes forty-eight hours; this, of
course, means hard going the whole time, but, as the various post-houses
on the road offer but little inducement for the traveller to prolong his
stay in them longer than is absolutely necessary, there is no temptation
to loiter on the way. I had been strongly advised to buy my own sledge,
and not trust to the ramshackle conveyances which could be hired at the
different stations, so I determined to go by the advice of people who
knew what Siberian travelling meant, and, with the assistance of a kind
friend, was fortunate in picking up a sledge in excellent condition
wonderfully cheap. All complete it cost me only fifty-two roubles, or
about £6 15_s._—such a bargain was it that, I was informed, I should
doubtless be able to sell it again at the same price anywhere.

In fact, my lucky star seemed to be in the ascendant at that time, for
just before leaving Yeniseisk I had a unique little adventure which made
my first impressions of Siberian sledging too agreeable for description
in plain Anglo-Saxon.

I had made my arrangements for starting, when a Siberian friend of mine
called and asked me if I would escort a lady as far as Krasnoiarsk. The
sledge held two, but I was alarmed at the idea, especially as I was
informed that the lady was a widow. Like Mr. Weller, I avoid widows.
It is one of my few guiding principles. I said, therefore, that my
baggage was multitudinous and heavy. My friend had placed me under so
many obligations that I could not refuse to reconsider the matter, so
it was arranged that I should be presented to the widow on the next
day to talk the matter over. I went to bed quite determined to have
my sledge to myself. In the morning I called. The lady came into the
room, and, instead of the wrinkled widow I had conjured up in my mind,
behold a most charming and graceful creature of twenty-five, with a most
vivacious manner and a smile which melted all the frost in my nature.
(I mentally decided that if it cost me another sledge for the baggage
the widow should be my companion.) So without the slightest hesitation I
said, twirling my moustaches, that I should feel myself a thousand years
younger if I might be permitted to escort her to Krasnoiarsk. I made
this remark in English, so neither the widow nor my friend understood
it; but I quickly assured them in my very best Parisian that on mature
consideration I had discovered that there was room for two in the sledge,
so the horses were ordered at the Government post-house, and at six
o’clock that evening we started on our first stage, about twenty-five
versts on the road. A party of friends accompanied us so far, and when
we reached the post-house they produced chickens and champagne enough
to have bribed the whole Press of Russia. Then good-bye, and away over
the moonlit snow, galloping noiselessly through the night. I smoked a
heavenly cigar; the widow puffed at a cigarette. And so we travelled,
halting only at the post-houses to change the horses. My sledge was
heavily laden with tinned meats and food to last me a long way. The
post-houses supplied tea and minor necessities.

[Illustration: “GOOD-BYE.”]

I was soon initiated by my charming companion into the mode of travelling
by sledge here. I learnt that horses (the usual number is a _troika_, or
three) were to be got at each post-house, the cost being three kopeks per
horse per verst (rather under a penny for two-thirds of a mile), plus
ten kopeks _progon_, or Government tax, per station. The _yemschik_, or
driver, changes with each relay, and is included in the charges, but
he naturally expects a small gratuity for himself. Although this is
not obligatory, it is a usual custom to give sixpence or so, according
to the length of the stage and how one was driven. The _padarojna_,
or Government permit, authorizing the traveller to have the necessary
horses, is a thing of the past, to all intents and purposes. Of course,
there is nothing against the traveller wasting his money on one, if he so
wishes, but he will find it a nuisance rather than otherwise. A good tip
to your last driver goes a long way further towards helping one than all
the Government padarojnas, in my humble opinion.

I have travelled right across Siberia without one, and had not the
slightest difficulty in getting horses anywhere, and in no case was
the delay longer than was necessary to get ready a cup of tea or
bouillon-fleet to keep out the cold; but, of course, I was exceptionally
fortunate in having had the advice of experienced friends before starting
on my journey, and all went as merrily as a wedding-bell, although I
knew but the merest smattering of the Russian language. The distances
between the different stations never exceeded twenty-five versts (about
sixteen miles), and this generally took a little over two hours to do,
so it may be remarked the pace was not slow. The post-station, I am
informed, is usually the best house in the village (which is not always
saying much), the owner being paid a certain sum yearly for the use of
his largest room, which he always has to keep ready for travellers,
and if necessary, for a small fee, to supply the inevitable samovar.
Refreshments, also, he in most cases undertakes to provide; but, as a
general rule, these only consist of black bread, milk, and frozen eggs,
so the hungry traveller who is at all fastidious does well to provide
himself beforehand with all his gastronomical necessaries. Of course, I
am now speaking of travelling on the route from Yeniseisk to Krasnoiarsk,
and not the “Great Post Road,” which I shall have future occasion to
describe. I found these houses, in most cases, clean and comfortably
furnished, but always heated to such a degree as to render them almost
unbearable; so stifling, as a rule, was the atmosphere that it was
generally like walking into a badly ventilated Turkish bath. I never
stayed a moment longer than was absolutely necessary, and was always glad
to get back again into my comfortable sledge.

The road was in exceptionally good condition for sledging; for the
greater part of the way it was like travelling on a velvet-pile carpet.
I never saw deeper snow anywhere, the horses at times being absolutely
buried up to their withers in it, while the trees on either side of us
were simply bent down with the weight of their fleecy pall. The scenery
was at times very beautiful, having almost the appearance of an English
park, and altogether very different to what I expected to find in the
wilds of Siberia.

Taking it all in all, therefore, I found sledging a very pleasant way
of travelling, and when snugly tucked up in my furs, as we dashed on
through the darkness of the night, I was lulled gradually to sleep by the
continuous jingle of the _duga_ bells, the Strand, the Paper, and in fact
London itself, seemed but as a dream of a far distant past. Of course
this sort of sentimental reverie is only inspired when one is on a good
road; if it is otherwise, well, one’s impressions are not of quite so
soothing a nature, more especially if they are caused by the corners of a
box or the roof of the sledge!

I had reason to congratulate myself on having provided myself with quite
a Siberian outfit in the way of furs, for I don’t think I ever felt such
cold in my life as I did on the road from Yeniseisk. If one’s face was
exposed to the wind for only a few seconds, one’s eyes and nostrils were
frozen together and one’s moustache became coated with thick ice. The
horses, also, were so covered with white frost that their colour was
absolutely unrecognizable. I found from my thermometer that the cold
averaged each day no less than 35 deg. below zero (Réaumur)! It will give
some idea of its intensity when I mention that whilst smoking in the open
air, and having occasion to expectorate, my saliva would often fall to
the ground as a solid lump of ice!

On reaching Krasnoiarsk, I was much surprised, and of course pleased,
to find quite a decent hotel, where I was accommodated with a couple
of really comfortable rooms well furnished, on fairly moderate terms.
They would, I fancy, have been considered good anywhere; and when I
add that they were fitted with electric bells, that there were sheets
and bedding to the bed, and that I had a _real_ “tub” every morning,
you will understand that it seemed like getting back to civilization,
with the ordinary “comforts” of everyday life once more. Krasnoiarsk
is decidedly a picturesque town; and, if it be so in winter, it must
be doubly pleasant in summer. Situated on one of the most beautiful
portions of the river Yenisei, in the centre of an amphitheatre of high
hills, every street has a sort of background of its own, so to speak,
and the effect is very pleasing. It is, of course, a much more important
place than Yeniseisk, being considerably larger, and is more advanced in
every respect. I was struck with this on the night of my arrival, by the
appearance and length of the lamp-lit streets we had to drive through
before reaching the hotel.

[Illustration: IN THE MEAT MARKET, KRASNOIARSK.]

The town was busy enough next morning, for it was market-day, and the
traffic in the streets abutting on the market-place was so great that it
required the services of several Cossacks, placed at different points for
the purpose, to control it; and they had their work cut out for them, for
there is evidently no rule of the road here, to all outward appearance,
and sledges of all sorts and sizes were dashing about in every direction
in the most reckless fashion. The Bolskoi Oulitza, or High Street,
presents a very animated appearance on a fine afternoon, and, if the
weather be not too cold, one sees many pretty faces and smart equipages.
Krasnoiarsk, owing to its sheltered position, is not so cold as
Yeniseisk, the average here during the winter months being only 15 deg.
below zero (Réaumur). Every afternoon there is quite a crowd of skaters
in the fine public gardens, and the scene is a very picturesque one,
for there are usually many officers on the ice, their striking uniforms
harmonizing well with the furs of the fair sex.

[Illustration: A TYPICAL SIBERIAN INTERIOR, KRASNOIARSK.]

Society in Krasnoiarsk is much gayer than in Yeniseisk. I was fortunate
in having letters of introduction to the Governor-General Telakoffski
and other officials, also to the two richest mine-owners in the place,
Messrs. Consnitsoff and Mativieff, so what with dinners and dances I
never found the time hang heavily on my hands of an evening; in fact,
it was rather too much the contrary, for so great is the hospitality
of the Siberians that it was positively difficult to get an evening to
one’s self. Most of the people spoke French or German, and, as many visit
Europe every year, they are, so to speak, well in touch with all subjects
of social and artistic interest, and the general “tone” of the dinners,
dances, and musical evenings was exactly like what one is accustomed to
on the continent. Excellent musicians absolutely abound here.

[Illustration: SNOW SCAVENGER, KRASNOIARSK.

[_To face p. 133._]

I fancy it would have astonished most people in England, or, for the
matter of it, anywhere, could they have been suddenly transported to the
spacious ball-room of the club (_sobranje_) on Christmas Day, when the
governor held his annual official reception. The magnificent suite of
rooms was simply packed with everybody who was anybody here; all officers
and Government officials in full uniform, the civilians in evening dress,
whilst the many ladies who were also present, dressed in the latest of
Parisian fashion, lent additional interest to a scene the like of which I
certainly never even dreamt of seeing in the “dreary land of exile.”

Of course Krasnoiarsk, like most places, has its “season,” which lasts
during the winter months only; during the heat of the summer the town has
almost a deserted appearance, I heard, as all the rich people then go
to their cool villas on the hills in order to escape from the scorching
rays of the sun and the blinding dust, and the place is left to the _Oi
polloi_.

[Illustration: THE CATHEDRAL, KRASNOIARSK.]

Having given some slight idea of the bright side of life in Krasnoiarsk,
a little about the reverse of the medal will doubtless be of interest.

In a vast country like Siberia, where a great part of the population—I
mean of the lower middle class and working orders—is composed of criminal
exiles, it may readily be imagined that there exists a peculiar state
of social opinion, which is positively amusing at times. If a man
conducts himself well, and is liked, it matters not a straw that he
be an exiled “gentleman criminal” doing his time, for he is received
almost everywhere, and one need not be ashamed to be seen associating
with him, as even the officials shake hands with him when they meet. He
himself makes no secret of his misdemeanour—rather the contrary, as a
rule—for most of them seem to think that “coming to reside in Siberia”
absolutely whitens them again in the eyes of society. As a matter of
fact, they are encouraged in this belief, for they are always spoken of
as “unfortunates.” Perhaps they are called so because they were found
out and sent here! On one occasion two men I knew very well met in my
rooms; both were criminal exiles who had formerly occupied high positions
in St. Petersburg—one, a German, having been “sent” for uttering forged
bonds; the other, a Russian, for embezzlement of Government money. As
they were not acquainted, I naturally introduced them to each other.
It was difficult to realize that these two well-dressed and polished
men, who spoke several languages fluently, were each doing a ten years’
penal sentence. After a short preamble on the usual everyday topics, the
Russian asked the German if he were an inhabitant of Krasnoiarsk.

“_Gott sei dank, nein_,” replied he; “I was only sent for ten years, and
my time is nearly up.”

“Ah! then you’re a _verschickte_? I thought you were. So am I. What did
you come for?”

“Oh, only for so and so. And you?”

“Oh, mine” (with a certain amount of pride) “was a big affair; I managed
to get _over_ forty thousand roubles out of the Government.”

And so the conversation rattled pleasantly on, gradually drifting into
(for me) more congenial subjects. There was not the least bit of shame
about them—they talked of their offences, while smoking their cigarettes,
as naturally as most men would relate an interesting episode in their
lives, and I sat and listened—and wondered. The same unbiassed way of
looking on the state of affairs exists among the lower orders; and
soldiers, with gangs of criminals in prison garb and heavy clanking
chains, push their way on foot through the crowd in the market-place,
attracting no notice, the prisoners being, to all appearance, stolidly
indifferent to their situation.

_Priviligierts_, or well-to-do criminals, that is to say, men of
intelligence who have received a good education, either in a Government
school or gymnase, and who have occupied good positions in their
time, when they are only guilty of such petty offences as forgery or
misappropriation, are never absolutely associated with the vulgar horde
of ordinary, everyday criminals. On their way to Siberia, although
they travel with the same gang, they do so apart, even in their own
conveyance, if they have the means to pay for it. On arrival at the
different _étapes_, the prisons in the villages, they are provided with
a room to themselves, till the detachment is ready to start again, and
on reaching their destination are turned loose, so to speak, and left
to shift for themselves. I had no difficulty whatever in learning all
this, for my various “criminal” acquaintances were not reticent; in fact,
seemed glad to tell me all about it, as an interesting story.

All this naturally excited my curiosity and made me desire to witness
personally, if possible, some of the proceedings, and, as good luck had
it, I was soon enabled to do so. An officer with whom I had been very
friendly was told off with his detachment to escort a large body of
prisoners coming from Tomsk; he had to take them over from their previous
escort some fifty versts back and convoy them to Krasnoiarsk; so he
courteously let me know of the probable time of his arrival at a certain
point on the road, so that I could drive out to meet him and make as many
photos and sketches as I wished. It is needless to say I jumped at the
invitation, and on the appointed day took an isvoschik and drove along
the Tomsk road.

We had driven some considerable distance without seeing the slightest
sign of life on the deserted highway, when suddenly on the crisp frosty
air I distinguished a faint distant sound, so peculiar and weird that
it immediately attracted my attention, as it was evidently approaching
us. It was not unlike the noise which would be produced by hundreds of
small birds singing all at once, yet I could see nothing of any sort
anywhere on the vast plain, so I drew my driver’s attention to it as well
as I could with my limited vocabulary of Russian. To him it was neither
novel nor interesting; he knew what it was at once. “The arrestanti are
coming,” he briefly told me; and shortly after, on ascending a rise in
the road which had concealed them from our view, there came in sight
a big body of men coming slowly along, and I then discovered that the
strange noise which had so impressed me was produced by the clanking of
the heavy chains they wore. But then, alas! all preconceived illusions
vanished, for it was a loathsome and depressing sight, and rendered
doubly so under the bright sunlight. There was absolutely nothing of the
poetic about it that I had been led to expect from the descriptions I
had read so often before coming to Siberia. It was simply a huge crowd
of what looked like (and probably was) the very scum of the earth, for
all races seemed to be represented amongst it, making as villanous and
evil-looking a lot of men as one could possibly see. In front and on
either side of the column were soldiers with rifles and fixed bayonets.
By the way, many writers speak of these soldiers as Cossacks; as a
matter of fact, Cossacks are now never under any circumstances used for
this or any duty in connection with prisoners, nor have they for many
years past. On the road, as well as round the prisons, only special men
are employed; these are known all over Russia and Siberia as “convoy
soldiers,” and form a big brigade, which is under the command of a
special general and a large staff of officers. All the men must have
served a certain time in the regular army before they are eligible for
this branch of the service.

[_To face p. 138._]

How any writer who has actually seen a gang of criminal exiles on the
march can describe it in any way as a pathetic sight beats me, and my
only astonishment is that convicts of other countries are not also spoken
of in the same sentimental way, for they are probably far worse off than
Siberian criminals, who, as a matter of fact, have a much better time
of it, _considering their crimes_, than they would have anywhere else,
barring, of course, the trifling discomfort of having to “foot it” the
whole distance if they are able. If they are footsore or lame they are
permitted to ride on one of the baggage conveyances. The more I learn
about the prisoners’ life, either on the road or in the ostrogs, the more
astonished I am at the humane way in which they are treated, and how
little is really known of it in the outer world. I am not referring to
the system as a whole, which I feel convinced is not only a wrong but a
demoralizing one, but to minor details, which show a kindly feeling on
the part of the authorities which is somewhat unexpected. For instance,
all Jews or Mohammedans receive ten kopeks (3_d._) per day, both on the
road and when in prison, so that they can purchase their own food, and
have it cooked according to their belief, the food and cooking being
looked after by one of their own religion deputed by themselves. In a
country where it is said that the Jews are so persistently persecuted
by the authorities, this comes as rather an astounding revelation, in
my opinion. I know nothing whatever about prison life in England, but I
am anxious to know if we treat our convicts in the same way. Political
prisoners never march (unless they wish to do so), but are conveyed
on telegas or sledges according to the season, and always follow some
distance behind the criminals, with whom they never are associated.
Considering how slowly the column advances, for I am informed it is
often no less than four or five months on the road, resting as it does
every second day, this must be an awful journey indeed for those who are
leaving friends, home, and in fact all behind them for ever. For these
“unfortunates,” when not criminal ones, all one’s sympathy is due; but
the canaille marching on ahead, and who are thus most _en évidence_, in
most cases richly deserve more than their fate, and ought to thank their
lucky stars they are Russian and not English convicts.

[Illustration: PRISONERS UNLOADING SLEDGES ON ARRIVAL AT PERASILNY,
KRASNOIARSK.

[_To face p. 140._]

[Illustration: VERIFICATION OF PRISONERS ON ARRIVAL AT PERASILNY,
KRASNOIARSK.

[_To face p. 141._]

In the rear of the column followed about twenty open sledges, on which
were women, children, footsore prisoners, and miscellaneous baggage. Even
the drivers were soldiers, and with their rifles across their knees
presented a curious appearance. Last of all came my friend, the officer
in charge of the detachment, in a luxurious covered-in sledge. There were
no “politicals” with the party.

As I was desirous of seeing for myself all that takes place on the
arrival of a gang of convicts at the _étape_ or perasilny of a large
town, I returned to Krasnoiarsk at the head of the detachment, and made
sketches and photos to my heart’s content of the unsavoury crowd of
ruffians following closely behind me.

The perasilny of Krasnoiarsk is situated on the outskirts of the town,
quite close to the _ostrag_, or regular prison, and, like most buildings
of its kind I have hitherto seen, built entirely of wood, even to the
high wall surrounding it. It is composed of several blocks of buildings
in which prisoners are indiscriminately placed pending their removal
to their ultimate destination. On arrival outside this building, the
convicts were formed up two deep for inspection, and immediately after
told off to unload the sledges and get their baggage; after which
they were marched into the building preparatory to being “verified.”
In a large bare whitewashed room sat the officer who had brought the
detachment and two prison officials, with a heap of papers before them.
All the prisoners were in an adjoining room, at the door of which stood
the _staroster_, or leader of the gang, waiting to call out the name as
each man was required.

[Illustration: THE STAROSTER OF THE GANG.]

It may not be generally known that in Russia every gang of prisoners has
its _staroster_, or captain, who is elected by themselves from amongst
their number, and who on all occasions acts as their spokesman. It is
difficult to ascertain on what particular merits he is elected—perhaps
it is that he is known to be the biggest dare-devil villain amongst
them, or that he is generally feared; at any rate, from all accounts,
the staroster has always such unbounded influence and power amongst his
fellows that if he were to decree the death of one of them there is no
doubt whatever but that the sentence would be carried out. As a matter of
fact, cases of the kind have been frequently known, the sort of liberty
which Siberian prisoners enjoy amongst themselves rendering this an easy
matter, and detection of the actual assassin absolutely impossible. A
weak prisoner, therefore, who is in the bad books of his staroster must
have a bad time of it, for he can be bullied and knocked about with
impunity, and would never dare to report it. I have heard of an incident
which happened quite recently, and which will give some idea of prison
life here.

A prisoner had the foolhardiness (for one can call it nothing else)
to inform the officials of the intended evasion of three of the most
desperate characters in the prison. Whether he did it out of revenge or
to suit his own ends is not known; at any rate, his treason (for such it
would undoubtedly be considered amongst his fellows) got somehow to be
known, and his death decreed by the staroster. In the mean time, however,
he had been removed to another cell, so it was arranged that it should
take place at the Government photographer’s, when the gang went to be
photo’d; but the officials heard of his danger, and he was removed to
another room—only just in time, for he would have been lynched, to a
certainty, otherwise. Although after this he was placed in another part
of the building, the news had spread, and his life was made so awful
for him that he was eventually placed in solitary confinement till he
could be sent to another prison. Capital punishment not existing in
Siberia (except in the rarest and most extreme of cases), criminals are
absolutely reckless, as they know they cannot get worse than they have
got, so there are many prisoners with a list of murders and other crimes
against them which would probably make an English criminal open his eyes.

[Illustration: GROUP OF PRISONERS (FROM A GOVERNMENT PHOTOGRAPH).]

But _revenons à nos moutons_ (or rather convicts). As the different men
were required the staroster called out their names, and they then came
to be “verified”—that is to say, compared with their photo, which is
attached to the paper relating to each one. I omitted to mention that all
convicts, before starting on the long march across Siberia, have their
heads shaved on one side, to render them immediately recognizable as
prisoners, and so as to prevent them from running away; and very hideous
does this operation render them, as there is no concealing it. Still,
in spite of it, numbers of them do escape, as I shall have occasion to
tell you in a subsequent chapter. After the “verification” the prisoners
were let loose into the courtyard of the perasilny, and left to shift
for themselves and find accommodation where they could in the building.
As I have already remarked, the perasilny is only a sort of depôt for
prisoners; they never remain in it long, only till a detachment is
starting for the prison or mine to which they have been consigned.

I was permitted to roam about all over the place with my sketch-book,
quite alone, so made sketches amongst the unsavoury crowd of ruffians
to my heart’s content, and although they came closer to me at times
than I desired, still I was in no way molested. It was certainly a most
extraordinary sight. Groups of evil, sullen-looking men were either
roaming about the spacious courtyard, or else hanging about in groups,
talking in an undertone to each other. Most of them were in chains,
and their clanking noise harmonized well with the gloomy surroundings.
It gave one the impression of being in a den of human wild beasts, and
judging from their faces I should fancy most of them were but little
better. They all seemed pretty well free to do what they pleased,
and I noticed many were smoking cigarettes or pipes. The principal
occupation, whilst I was there, seemed to be noting the new arrivals as
they individually made their appearance inside the gate. In some cases
the new-comers immediately found friends among the crowd, in which,
event he was introduced by them to the others, and the mutual greetings
were most effusive, and doubtless sufficient to raise feelings of envy
in the breasts of younger prisoners standing by, and who were unknown
to criminal fame. I was told afterwards that new-comers, if they are
absolutely unknown to any one in their cell, have to stand a sort of
supper, or _bienvenue_—pay their “footing,” as a matter of fact. Fancy
this sort of thing in an English prison! I naturally asked how a prisoner
would manage if he had no money. “He can always get enough for that,” was
the reply. How?

Whilst I was strolling about making notes and sketches, a warder came up
and asked me if I would like to visit the building, and volunteered to
show me over it. Naturally I accepted the offer, and was much interested,
and I may say astonished, at all I saw. There were three blocks of wooden
buildings, the windows of which were heavily grated; though why there
were bars I could not make out, for all doors were unlocked, and the
prisoners appeared to be free to go and come as they pleased. It was
more like a large school-house than a prison. In the rooms, or rather
dormitories, the same liberty prevailed, as there seemed to be no one to
maintain discipline or order; in fact, there was such a row in all of
them that the warder accompanying me had to call out several times at
the top of his voice in order to get a little silence, as the noise was
simply deafening. The sleeping accommodation in all the rooms consisted
of the usual sloping wooden shelves fixed down the centre of the room.

What astonished me most in the whole place was the married prisoners’
quarters; for in the large dormitory there were at least two hundred men,
women, and children of all ages herded together indiscriminately. No
words can fitly describe the scene. The evil faces, the babel of voices,
the crying of children, the clanking of the men’s chains, and, above
all, the indescribable stench which seems inseparable from the Siberian
prisons, all combined to make as hideous an impression as could well
be imagined. All round, seated or standing, were little family parties,
so to speak. Tea was going on at the moment I entered, and the women
naturally were in their element; in fact, it was more like a picnic
of the lower orders than a prison scene. The heat of the place, which
appeared to be without ventilation, was as usual fearfully oppressive,
and many of the men and women were in the very scantiest of attires, for
decency did not appear to affect them much, and the sight of so many poor
little innocent children, in such foul surroundings, struck me as being
particularly horrible.

[Illustration: A “PRIVILIGIERT,” OR PRIVILEGED PRISONER.]

We afterwards visited the room of a _priviligiert_, or swell prisoner,
who was too good to associate with the ordinary horde of vulgar
scoundrels, although possibly he may have caused as much misery in his
time to his fellow-creatures as any of them. The “gentleman” in this
case, I heard, “wrote too well.” He was in ordinary civilian attire,
and looked a well-dressed, gentlemanly fellow. His little son was with
him in the room he occupied, which was really not an uncomfortable one,
for there were two real beds in it, with sheets, bedding, etc., washing
appliances, looking-glass, tea-things, plates, saucers, etc.—in fact,
quite a little _ménage_. He was sitting on the bed when I entered, and
my visit evidently did not seem to please him much, for he immediately
turned his back on me and began muttering to himself. However, I went in
all the same and had a good look round, and made a sketch of him in spite
of his ungracious reception.

[Illustration: PEASANT WOMEN SELLING PROVISIONS TO PRISONERS.]

On coming out of the prison I was surprised to see quite a little crowd
of peasant women with baskets of bread, etc., gathered round a hole in
the outer wall, through which they were selling the provisions to such
fortunate prisoners who happened to have a little money. It was a curious
sight, and well worthy of a sketch, I thought—the grimy hands thrust out
through the aperture, and in the background the mass of swarthy, evil
countenances—a subject worthy of Doré.

As I was driving back to town with my friend, the conversation naturally
turned on the scenes I had just witnessed, and I asked him if no work
was ever done in the prisons. He then informed me that all work, except
such as wood-cutting, getting water, etc., is optional; if the prisoners
can find work and care to take it they are at liberty to do so, as there
are specially reserved rooms for them to work in. Many, he told me,
made money by making cigarettes, at which they were very clever, and
naturally could turn them out cheaper than they could be bought at the
shops. Being in want of some at the moment, I thought it would not be a
bad idea to get some made by a prisoner, just out of curiosity. So the
next day I purchased some tobacco and paper, and went to the _ostrog_
(the regular prison, not the depôt) with a friend to interpret for me. It
seemed a usual sort of proceeding, for the gaoler we spoke to about it
said immediately, “_Morgenor_” (it can be done), and opening the large
heavily ironed and barred door leading into the courtyard, called out at
the top of his voice, “_Paperossnik_” (a cigarette-maker). There was a
clanking of chains, and in a few minutes a miserable-looking wretch in
prison clothes came forward. I had only brought a little tobacco, so it
was not a big commission I had to give him. On asking what they would
cost, he replied that he would make me a thousand for sixty kopeks (1_s._
6_d._), that these few he would make me as a sample, and I could give him
what I chose for them. However, the result, though not exactly a failure,
was not a success, as they were not particularly well made, and I had
strong reason to believe that at least a third of the tobacco had been
purloined, for I had got very many less cigarettes than I ought to have
received. So much for convict labour in the prison itself. I shall have
occasion, in a subsequent chapter, to speak about outdoor employment of
the prisoners.

Of course, there are many political exiles living in Krasnoiarsk, but
most of them are time-expired prisoners who cannot leave the district.
At the time of my visit several were employed as clerks, and so forth,
at the various Government offices; and, as far as I could see or hear
(and I had many opportunities for so doing), were not treated with the
severity one hears so much of in England. As a matter of fact, there
is a great deal more complaint out of Siberia about the tyranny of
officials than there is inside it, and the average notions about life
there seems to me to be the outcome of entire ignorance. I must say,
however, that the Russian officials take things too much _au sérieux_.
They “drop upon” people for doing things which in England would be
laughed at and forgotten in twenty-four hours. They don’t believe in
the safety-valve principle, but maybe one official thinks that if he
doesn’t take notice of a thing some other official will, and probably
report the first official into the bargain. Everybody is watched, from
a governor downwards. You don’t see the working of the system, but it
is there all the same. I will give an instance in proof of this. There
was a fancy-dress ball at the club, and, as usual in Siberia, everybody
wore a mask. One young fellow thought he would create a sensation—and he
did. He appeared as a sort of walking advertisement. On his breast were
written some of the advantages of life in Siberia. On his back were the
disadvantages, so strongly worded that a police official tapped him on
the shoulder and requested him to step into a private room. This he did,
his mask was removed, and it was found that he was a young student at the
Tomsk University. He was told to leave the place, notwithstanding the
indignation of the other guests at the official’s action. The official
reported the matter; there was telegraphing backwards and forwards;
the culprit was finally sent back to Tomsk, and I don’t know what
became of him. Probably he is at this moment in solitary exile in some
out-of-the-way place. At any rate, as every one at the ball agreed in
conversation about the affair, his life was practically ruined through
a freak which, in any country not under Russian rule, would simply have
been laughed at.

Local malefactors, whatever their offence, are first taken before the
chief of police (_politcemeaster_), who, if the charge be only a petty
one, disposes of it himself; if, however, it be of a grave nature it
is sent for trial at the high court of justice of the district. I was
informed that it goes very hardly indeed with a liberated criminal exile
if he is ever caught committing a felony in Siberia, for he has then but
a very slight chance of ever regaining his liberty. The police court
itself offered little of interest, being merely a large room with a big
table in it, at the head of which sat the chief and all his officers. The
prisoners were brought in in charge of a soldier or a warder, and stood
about anywhere, for there was no dock, and the proceedings, though novel,
were not interesting.

I had heard a good deal about the “night refuges for the destitute,”
which exist in all Siberian towns, so was determined to visit one,
although at first it seemed likely to prove a difficult matter, as my
friends were not eager to go to such an uninviting den, even in the
interests of art. However, at last I persuaded one to accompany me
late one night. The refuge naturally was situated in the poorest part
of the city, and we had some difficulty at first in finding it. It only
consisted of two fairly large rooms, lighted by a swinging lamp. The
effect was almost the same as in the prison, for there was the same
fearful heat and stench, the same crowd of unkempt wretches, most of
whom looked like old gaol-birds. The only difference was that these two
rooms were simply packed to their utmost capacity, every available corner
being occupied, even to the floor underneath the sloping shelf which
served as the sleeping-place—so much so, in fact, that it was positively
difficult to get in without treading on some one’s face or body. As may
be imagined, I hurried up with my sketch as much as possible, for I was
anxious to get out into the open air again without delay. Beyond the
sloping shelf no other “bedding” is supplied, the men having to provide
any further luxuries themselves; but the heating arrangements were so
complete that no coverings whatever were needed. Besides the actual
lodging, the men are given a mug of tea and piece of bread for supper,
and the same in the morning for breakfast. Those who are known to have
a little money are charged five kopeks (1½_d._) for the lodging. Before
leaving, I was permitted to have a peep into the female dormitory, which
was comparatively empty, for I only saw three miserable old hags in their
“beauty sleep.”

[Illustration: WATCHMAN ON DUTY IN FIRE TOWER, KRASNOIARSK.

[_To face p. 155._]

As in most Siberian towns where wood is principally used in the
construction of the houses, the fire brigade forms a most important
feature in the municipal arrangements. All over the city are to be seen
large and in many cases handsome watch-towers, in which watchmen are
always stationed, with a big bell close at hand to give the alarm when
necessary; whilst below several manuals are in constant readiness with a
supply of warm water during the winter, to avoid risk of its freezing.

The theatre is really quite an imposing building, and rendered more so
by being situated in the centre of an immense open space. Performances
take place in it three times a week during the winter, and, judging from
the way they are patronized, histrionic art is evidently well appreciated
here.

Taking it all in all, therefore, I found Krasnoiarsk a very interesting
place, and well worth the six weeks’ stay I made in it; in fact, I was
quite sorry to leave it.




CHAPTER XV.

MY JOURNEY FROM KRASNOIARSK TO IRKUTSK.

    My servant Matwieff—The Great Post Road—The post-houses—Tea
    caravans—Curious effect of road—Siberian lynch law—Runaway
    convicts—A curious incident—The post courier—An awkward
    accident—Arrival at Irkutsk.


[Illustration: MY SERVANT.]

Travelling in Siberia is evidently altered very much for the better
during the last three years, for my experiences on the Great Post Road
were very different indeed to those described by the author of a recent
book of travel in these parts. Perhaps, however, the fact of my doing
the journey during the winter may to a certain extent account for it;
but whatever the cause, the impressions received are the same, and the
eight days’ journey, though certainly a somewhat tedious one, will
remain in my memory as one amongst the many interesting episodes of my
Siberian wanderings. After all I had read about the many difficulties and
discomforts, not to say dangers, of this long journey, I must confess
that it was not without certain misgivings that I at last decided to make
a move and to start from my comfortable quarters in the Gostinnitza
Gadaloff and push on further East, in accordance with the route I had
planned out for myself. My numerous friends, on learning this, were so
unanimous in their advice to me not to travel alone, in case of my being
taken ill on the road or meeting with an accident, that I was at length
persuaded, almost against my will, to listen to them and take a servant
with me; and, as will be seen, it was very fortunate I did so.

Once it was known I was in want of a servant, I had no difficulty in
finding men who were willing to go with me to Irkutsk, even on the off
chance of my not requiring a servant when once there; in fact, it was
an _embarras de richesses_, and I had my choice. The principal question
was to find some one who was accustomed to travelling. Luckily, I
suddenly heard of an ex-sergeant of gendarmes who was anxious to get to
the capital, and who would be glad to give his services as servant to
me in return for a “free passage.” The mere fact of his having been in
the Gendarmerie was in itself sufficient recommendation, as only men
of exceptionally good character are admitted into this branch of the
service; so without hesitation I decided on taking him, and he eventually
turned out to be the best and most conscientious servant I have ever
had; he also was the biggest, for he stood no less than 6 ft. 3 in., and
was a typical fellow of his class. My journey to Irkutsk was therefore
_une affaire arrangée_, for from the moment I arranged with Sergeant
Matwieff all trouble on my part ceased, for he simply took charge of the
arrangements as though he had travelled with me for years, and all I had
to do was to decide when to start, and leave the rest to him, even to
packing my things, ordering the horses, and the host of minor details
inseparable from Siberian travel. It is almost unnecessary to add that
he spoke no language but Russian, so our means of conversation were very
limited, and most of the time I had to make him understand by means of
pantomime.

At last my preparations were complete, and on the evening of Sunday,
January 25, I started towards the next stage of my long journey, and
shortly after Krasnoiarsk, with its many pleasant associations, was but a
reminiscence of the past.

The road for some miles, after leaving the town, lay along the ice in
the very centre of the river Yenisei. As it was a very bright moonlight
night, the effect was novel and beautiful, the track was smooth and
level, and the horses went along at their top speed. I was gradually
lulled into a deep sleep, and woke to find the first stage of twenty-nine
versts accomplished and the sledge in the post-yard of Botoiskaya. The
little village was slumbering; not a light was to be seen in any of the
windows; in the post-house was the only sign of life. Looking up the
quaint street, which in the moonlight had a weird appearance, with its
tumble-down cottages, I saw a most curious sight. The centre of the
road had exactly the appearance of being laid with railway sleepers; as
far as one could see, the long ridges in the snow followed each other so
regularly, that I could not help asking what was the reason of so cutting
up the road. To my astonishment I was told that these ridges were caused
by the thousands of horses of the caravans which had passed along the
road since the commencement of the winter. The horses instinctively know
that they can get a better foothold by walking in each other’s footsteps,
and fall into the habit of doing so almost mechanically. I shortly after
had the first of many opportunities of noting this for myself, for
presently a large tea caravan came along, and I observed that it hardly
ever happened that a horse stepped out of the grooves, so much so that
the drivers strolling alongside seemed to have very little to do, as the
animals appeared to know all that was expected of them.

This, my first sight of a caravan on the Great Post Road, was but the
forerunner of what we met or passed both day and night almost without
intermission the whole way to Irkutsk. While many were laden with
European goods bound eastward, most of them were coming from China
with tea. So great, in fact, was this traffic that I could not help
wondering where all this immense quantity of tea can possibly go to, more
especially when one comes to consider that what comes to Europe by the
Great Post Road is only a small proportion of the annual amount exported
from China. The tea of China, packed in bales of hide, is brought across
the Gobi desert by ox-waggons or by camels as far as Kiakhta, the Russian
frontier town, where it is transferred to sledges or Siberian carts,
according to the season, and the long journey to Tomsk is then commenced,
a journey taking over two months. The same horses go the whole way; but
they are allowed to take their own pace, and seldom do more than three
miles an hour. At Tomsk the tea is stored till the spring, when it is
taken by river steamer into Russia. Tea brought overland is said to
retain more of its original flavour than that which, packed in lead, has
made a sea voyage, but the difference is probably so slight that only an
expert could detect it.

There are comparatively very few men in charge of these immensely
valuable consignments, which often consist of as many as two hundred
and fifty sledges—one man to about seven horses as a rule—and these
at night take it in turns to keep watch; for on the Great Post Road a
peculiar form of highway robbery exists: bales of tea are frequently cut
loose and stolen in the dark hours by thieves, who lurk around to take
advantage of a driver dozing on his sledge. The poor fellow then has to
pay dearly for his “forty winks,” as he has to make good the loss out of
his wages—a very serious matter, considering the value of a large bale
of tea. Last year, I am informed, these thefts became so frequent and
the thieves so daring that at last the drivers combined to have their
revenge, and when on one or two occasions they managed to catch a thief
_flagrante delicto_ they actually lynched him in quite a North-American
Indian style. Bending a stout birch sapling to the ground by means of a
rope, they fastened the back of the victim’s head to it by the hair, and
then cut the rope, releasing the tree, which immediately sprang back to
its original position, and the unfortunate wretch was literally scalped.
He was then left to his fate. It is probable that a few examples of this
kind will have as deterrent an effect on intending thieves as on the
victims themselves. But to return to my narrative.

We had no difficulty in getting horses, and, after a stoppage of
twenty-five minutes, were rattling merrily along the frost-bound highway.
It was a bitterly cold night, no less than 40 deg. below zero (Réaumur),
but till now I had not felt it much, as the wind was at our backs.
Unfortunately, a turn in the road brought it right against us, and then
I felt such cold that in all my life I never experienced any like it.
Although I was buried in furs, and the hood of the sledge down, there was
no keeping it out. Moustache, nostrils, and eyelashes were frozen hard,
and my dacha, where it came in contact with my face, was one solid mass
of ice, caused by my breath, and to this my skin actually stuck.

The wonder to me was how the yemschiks stand it as they do; but I suppose
they get case-hardened to it in time—frost-proof, in fact, for rolled up
in their sheepskins they seem impervious to temperature, taking it all
as a matter of course. As to the horses, although they were always so
covered with frost as to have the appearance of being thickly coated with
snow, they never seemed to mind it a bit, and would keep up the same pace
the whole stage; standing afterwards in the post-yard as quiet as sheep
while their icy coats were, so to speak, broken off with a primitive sort
of curry-comb attached to the handle of the driver’s whip. Twenty-five
versts, or about two and a half hours of this sort of temperature was
quite enough at a stretch, as I soon found, and the sight of the village
boundary fence was always a welcome sight as betokening the end of
another spell.

The novelty of sledge-travelling soon wears off, especially on a road
like this, where there is so little to vary the eternal monotony of the
dense forests or rolling plains on either side of one. The same dreary
aspects seemed to repeat themselves over and over again almost at every
turn of the road, whilst the various villages resembled each other so
much that it was at times hard to believe we were not returning to the
one we had just left. I do not propose wearying you with a detailed
account of the forty-three stations between Krasnoiarsk and Irkutsk, for
a description of one, which I have already given, suffices for all—so
much so, in fact, that although I tried hard to see something more to
sketch, I could discover nothing I had not already seen and sketched on
our journey up the Yenisei or in Yeniseisk or Krasnoiarsk. Where, for
instance, in France every little “pays” has its individual character,
so to speak, here in Siberia from one end to the other of this enormous
continent all is the same, and if you have studied one portion of it,
you have studied all (of course, with the exception of the aborigines,
who naturally differ according to their tribes). For my own part, I can
assert that I saw absolutely no difference, either in the build of the
houses, or the dress or customs of the inhabitants, all the way from
Golchika, the tiny settlement on the tundras far away within the Arctic
circle, and Kiakhta, a distance of nearly three thousand miles; and, from
what I hear, it is the same from the Urals to the Pacific. It almost
seems as though it had been ordained by Imperial Ukase that all over this
vast empire the inhabitants should everywhere adopt the same costumes and
build and furnish their houses always on the same pattern.

[Illustration: ARRIVAL AT A POST STATION.]

What strikes one most on the long stretches of road is the total absence
of isolated cottages or farmhouses which so help to enliven a landscape
in Europe. Once beyond the fence which encircles the limits of each
village commune, all signs of habitation and even cultivation instantly
cease, and no more are seen till the next commune is reached. The road
then passes through a big wooden gate, with high posts on either side;
just inside this is a small sentry-box, in which a watchman is always
stationed during the summer months to see that the gate is kept closed,
and so keep the cattle from straying outside the boundary. (In the winter
the gate is always open.) In the distance one then sees the long dreary
stretch of village street, with the green-roofed _ostrog_, or prison, and
the public granary standing out in relief against the dilapidated wooden
hovels. Everywhere, as a rule, there seems an entire absence of human
life. The post-house is only distinguishable from the other houses by its
having black and white lamp-posts on either side of the door, and the
Russian coat-of-arms painted on a board over it.

Of course there were flourishing villages here and there, but so few.
Kansk, Nijni Udinsk, Touloung, and the large village of Koutoulik, are
really the only places worth mentioning in this long road. At Touloung
the streets were actually lighted up at night. At these places, of
course, the post-houses were better furnished and looked after, but they
were but oases among the number of wretched and uncomfortable ones;
although I must in justice admit that with only one or two exceptions
they were all as clean as soap and water could make them; but then, soap
and water does not restore dilapidations or rebuild ramshackle places,
unfortunately, and many were very dilapidated indeed, and scarcely worthy
being called “Government post-houses.”

The same ideas of ventilation evidently prevail all over Siberia, for
everywhere I found the windows hermetically sealed, and in most instances
when the stove was in full blaze the atmosphere was simply stifling, as
may be imagined after it has been confined in these stuffy rooms for
the six long winter months, and being breathed over and over again by
hundreds and hundreds of travellers. However, _à la guerre comme à la
guerre_, and in the wilds of Siberia it would have been absurd to expect
to find European notions of sanitation.

With but one exception I had no difficulty whatever in getting horses at
each station; in fact, in most instances the fresh team was generally
ready to start before I was, so I could not complain about being kept
waiting. The one exception I refer to occurred at Kansk, where I arrived
unfortunately too late at night to be able to look round this interesting
and flourishing little town, as I should have had ample time to have
done, for on reaching the post-house, the _staroster_ (as the postmaster
is called) courteously informed me that no horses could be had till three
the next morning—six hours to wait. Luckily the waiting-room was as clean
and comfortable as one could have wished it, so I decided to have supper
at once and “turn in” on the sofa for a few hours. A tin of Irish stew,
washed down (the Irish stew, not the tin) by a glass or two of vodka and
a cup of black coffee, seemed a feast for a king after the hasty meals
I had been having since leaving Krasnoiarsk, so when I did turn in an
hour later it was to immediately fall into the deep sleep which naturally
follows when one has “got outside” a square meal and one has a good
digestion. Although I had particularly asked the station-master to call
me as soon as the horses arrived, I suppose, like the Irish servant in
Lever’s story, “he did not like to knock too hard at the door for fear
of waking me;” for I was only awakened at eight o’clock the next morning
by the sun streaming into my eyes. Still, I was not exactly sorry for
the few hours I had lost, as I had had a splendid rest, and after a good
sluice in a bucket of ice-cold water felt “fit as ninepence” (though why
ninepence should be fit I know not), and did ample justice to a good
breakfast before starting.

[Illustration: INTERIOR OF A POST HOUSE.

[_To face p. 166_]

Moreover, as it turned out, after leaving the town we passed through
some of the finest forest scenery I have ever seen, and which it would
have been a pity to have missed, for there was really so little that
was interesting that I should have been sorry to have passed any that
was, during the night. Either the big road, for some reason or other,
was blocked, or else the driver thought he knew a near cut; anyway,
we shortly after made a _détour_ of several miles and went straight
across the forest itself by a rough sort of track. It was a wild,
desolate-looking place, the trees meeting overhead causing a dim twilight
which considerably helped to heighten the effect—just the sort of place
one would not have been astonished to meet a bear or a pack of wolves in;
in fact, I was fondly hoping to see something and got my rifle ready.
But in the still mysterious depths of the dense jungle no sign whatever
of life was visible; over the thick carpet of snow, the sledge glided
noiselessly, even the sound of horses’ hoofs was muffled, and the deadly
silence of the surroundings was only broken now and again by the subdued
jingle of the duga bells. I could not help thinking how serious it would
have been if an accident had occurred to the sledge or horses just about
here; for the “near cut” was evidently not the usual road, as the whole
length of it we were entirely alone.

It must have taken us at least three hours to do the next fifteen miles
or so, for the track was so narrow in places, and so blocked by abutting
trees, that at times it seemed doubtful whether the sledge would pass at
all, so tight a squeeze was it. However, at last we got through and out
into the broad daylight on the high-road again, when for a few seconds
the light seemed absolutely dazzling after the semi-obscurity we had just
left. Although we passed through many miles of dense forest after this,
we did so on the regular road and in the full glare of the midday sun, so
my impressions were very different to those received in the lonely track
we had just come through.

The next day or two were uneventful, and as there was nothing new to see,
the stoppages at the different post-houses usually came as a pleasant
break to the journey, and an excuse to get out of the sledge and call for
the samovar. By the way, talking of samovars, it is really astonishing
how quickly one takes to the Russian way of drinking weak tea without
milk, boiling hot, out of a tumbler. There is no doubt about it that
one can appreciate the full flavour of the tea better that way than as
we drink it in England, although to drink out of a cup appears to me to
be much more convenient than out of a tumbler; and I am surprised the
Russians don’t think so, for there is not the slightest doubt which is
the more practical.

An interesting incident occurred shortly after leaving the village of
Rasgonnaiaa. I had learnt at the station that a large gang of prisoners
had passed a few days previously, so hurried on as much as possible in
the hope of overtaking it, and at any rate seeing something which would
break the monotony of the journey. The road, which hitherto had passed
through forest-land, was now open on either side, and for miles ahead
the rolling, snow-covered plains stretched, relieved, so to speak, only
by the winding road and its endless vista of telegraph-poles. During the
morning I had noticed that we were continually passing rough-looking
men on foot, hurrying along, always in the same direction, as though
on important business. Now, in any other country than Siberia such an
occurrence would pass unnoticed, for “Shank’s pony” is a cosmopolitan
beast, and among certain classes generally the only means of locomotion.
Here, however, in the wilds of Siberia, a foot-traveller is an extreme
rarity outside a village. Hence my surprise. At last it occurred to me to
ask Matwieff if he could tell me what these curious-looking men were,
and what they were doing on the road so far from a village. Imagine my
surprise when, without the slightest hesitation, he told me they were
_bradiagga_, or runaway prisoners, from the _parti_ on ahead. I could
scarcely believe it, so he suggested our stopping the next one we met,
and he would then convince me of the truth of his statement. To him there
was evidently not so much novelty in the incident as to me, for as an
ex-gendarme he could probably “spot” a prisoner at a glance.

I had not long to wait, for in a short time there appeared in the far
distance another of these gentlemen hurrying towards us. I thought it
would not be a bad idea to “take his photo,” so ordered the yemschik
to stop, and, getting out of the sledge, waited till the fellow got up
abreast of us. Matwieff then called out to him to come over to where
we were, for he was on the far side of the road, which (as is usual in
Siberia) was of enormous width. The fellow, in his anxiety to get along
as quickly as possible, had evidently not noticed that we were stopping,
for when he heard us call out to him and he looked up and caught sight
of us, a most curious look came over his face, which we could not help
remarking. Whether it was the sight of my revolver (which I always wore
outside my coat) or the gendarme cap Matwieff had on, I cannot tell,
but he looked round wildly for a second over the snow-covered plain as
though meditating a “bolt;” then realizing, perhaps, that he could not
possibly get away, he seemed to make up his mind, and came slowly over
towards us.

When he got close up we then saw that he was simply trembling in every
limb with fright, whilst his mouth was quivering to such an extent that
it was positively painful to see such a picture of abject fear. Although
he was a great big hulking fellow, and had an ugly looking cudgel under
his arm, he was as unnerved and cowed as a beaten dog, and evidently
expected us to immediately handcuff him and take him back at the tail of
the sledge to the _parti_ he had escaped from. The delight of the poor
wretch when he learnt that I only wanted to photograph him was almost
curious to witness, and he offered no objection to my carrying out my
fell purpose. Matwieff then, to prove to me that the man really was as he
said, a _bradiagga_, coolly went up to him, and, lifting up his sheepskin
coat, lo and behold, underneath were his prison clothes, whilst hidden
by his high peasant boots were the ends of his chains still attached to
the anklets, which he had not yet had time to remove. His head also, he
showed me by removing his cap, had been half shaved in the usual convict
manner. Whatever his crime, it was certainly no business of ours to
re-arrest him, so I took the photo of him and then gave him a few kopeks
for standing. Before letting him go, out of curiosity I asked him where
he was going to. To my astonishment he replied, “Moscow.” The idea of his
setting out, on foot, to accomplish over three thousand miles home, in
the depth of winter, struck me as being an awful task to undertake.

At the next station, the staroster, on my mentioning the incident,
informed me that in the village they were simply infested with runaway
convicts after a convoy had passed, and that at night the barns and
outhouses were always occupied; he had known as many as a dozen men
sleeping in the bath-house of the station. (The baths in a Russian
village are generally in wooden outbuildings.) The peasants, he further
informed me, so far from interfering with the fuyards, or thinking
even of giving them up, supply them on the quiet with bread and broken
victuals, so that, at any rate, there is no fear of them dying of hunger
within the village commune. As a matter of fact, the men themselves know
that they can always reckon on something to eat in every place they have
to pass through, and it has grown to be such a regular custom, this
providing of food for them, that they take it as a matter of course.

The wind, which hitherto had somewhat lulled, now recommenced with
renewed force. Fortunately, however, owing to the road going in a
different direction, it was at our backs; for so hard did it blow, that
the country presented the effect almost of steaming under it owing to
the driving particles of snow, and one could only see a few yards ahead
through the sort of white fog enveloping everything, and we should have
doubtless had an unpleasant time if we had been going against it.

[Illustration: THE IMPERIAL MAIL.

[_To face p. 173._]

I was much struck with the scarcity of travellers we met, either on the
road or in the stations, for only on two or three occasions did we meet
any one or find the waiting-room occupied. At one place the Imperial
Mail, bound for Irkutsk, came up while we were there—half a dozen of the
shabbiest and most ramshackle of sledges, in charge of an equally seedy
and shabby individual in a dirty old sheepskin coat, and with an enormous
revolver in his belt. I could not help feeling somewhat disappointed,
for from what I had previously read I had expected to see a dashing
courier, resplendent in green and gold, and armed to the teeth, so had my
sketch-book in readiness as soon as I heard that the mail had arrived.
At another station I found the room occupied by a family, consisting of
a lady and gentleman, and no less than four children and a maid. By some
accident I discovered that the lady spoke German, so we had quite a long
chat together. She informed me that they had come straight away from far
Vladivostock, and were going to St. Petersburg, a journey which, from
start to finish, would probably take them _ten weeks_, that is, if they
stopped nowhere on the road. Her husband, who was a Government official,
she told me, had been in bad health for some time past, and had been
recommended to go to St. Petersburg to get the highest of medical advice.
This is the longest journey I ever heard of “to see a doctor.” I saw
them start again shortly after, and although there were so many of them,
they had such a huge sledge that they all seemed to pack into it quite
comfortably.

You may imagine how refreshing, so to speak, it was, after the sort of
wilderness we had come through, to find that the next station, Touloung,
was quite a busy little town, its many and well-built streets actually
lighted up, whilst several important-looking shops and large houses
helped to give quite a lively appearance to the place. The post-house
itself was also quite “up to” the town, and not only boasted of several
large and well-furnished rooms, but also a big apartment, most handsomely
decorated, in which, I was informed, the Governor of Irkutsk held
receptions when he had occasion to visit the town. Touloung, though an
old town, was certainly one of the prettiest and most flourishing I had
passed through, and my only regret was that it was night when we got
there, for I should like to have sketched some of the bits I saw, notably
the beautiful house of the merchant, Mr. Shokounoff, which stands exactly
opposite the post-station, for it struck me as being a splendid specimen
of Russian architecture. After doing a little shopping, and a look round,
and a “feed,” once more I got under weigh.

The next few stations were wretchedly uncomfortable, or anyway they
seemed so, perhaps out of contrast to the nice one we had just left; so
there was little temptation to loiter in them longer than was absolutely
necessary whilst waiting for the fresh horses. At Tiretskaya, where we
had to cross the Oka, the road went along the centre of the river on the
ice for several miles, and the high wooded banks on either side gave it a
most peculiar and striking appearance, not unlike a railway cutting.

The next place of interest we came to was the large village of
Koutoulik (or, rather, small town, for it contains over eleven hundred
inhabitants). The post-house here was without exception the smartest on
the whole road. The waiting-room, which was really well-furnished, was
not only full of plants and flowers, but actually had pictures on the
walls, not the usual cheap, religious ones, but good oleographs; whilst
to add to the good impression caused by these attempts at luxury, I
learnt that there was a “real dinner” ready if I cared to take of it.
You may imagine I jumped at it after living on tinned food for nearly a
week. The wife of the staroster had evidently been a professed cook in
her time, judging from the result and the way I was served. After dinner
I lit my pipe and had a stroll through the village, whilst Matwieff was
looking after the horses. The streets presented so lively and animated an
appearance that I spent more time than I had intended to, wandering about
in search of subjects. The inhabitants were evidently used to artists,
for neither my sketch-book nor my camera attracted any particular
attention.

During the night after leaving Koutoulik occurred the accident which I
have already referred to. We had started from the station of Polovilnaya
at about 1.30 a.m., and I was soon fast asleep. How long I had been
asleep I know not, but I was suddenly woke up by an indescribable sort
of sensation that the sledge had “changed front.” I sprang up and,
raising the hood, looked out, when, to my no slight dismay, I discovered
that we were on a long and steep hill and that the horses had lost all
control over the sledge which was “skidding” down sideways at a rate
that increased every instant. Matwieff was immediately as wide awake as
myself, and we both sat and looked out and waited breathlessly for the
result, which was absolutely inevitable, for it would have been utter
madness to have attempted to jump out, encumbered as we both were with
our heavy furs and the stiff apron of the sledge. Although the driver
urged the horses to their very top speed they could not get ahead of the
heavy vehicle, which had obtained complete mastery over them and was
simply dragging them along with it. Just before reaching the bottom of
the hill was a slight rise in the road such as one sees on a switchback
railway; here the driver was shot off his seat as out of a catapult,
and a few yards further down the sledge turned completely over into a
huge drift of snow by the side of the road. The luggage was so firmly
wedged in that it barely moved, and both Matwieff and I were also so
firmly boxed in that we found ourselves lying on our sides completely
helpless. Fortunately a large caravan was coming along at the moment,
and the men, seeing our predicament, immediately hurried up and soon
righted the sledge again. The horses, I forgot to add, stopped at once as
soon as they felt the resistance offered by the deep snow. This little
misadventure was evidently a usual occurrence to them, and also to the
driver, who turned up unhurt and smiling a few seconds after, and soon we
were off again as fast as ever.

For the moment I thought we had got off scot free, for the sledge was
uninjured, and neither Matwieff nor I felt any ill effects from the
spill. A few stations further on, however, when going to get out of the
sledge I felt a nasty pain in my right ankle, and found, on trying to
walk, that my leg was so stiff I could not use it. Here was a pretty
go! I was evidently in for a bad sprain, and I knew what that meant.
Luckily Matwieff was an old soldier in every sense of the word, and rose
to the occasion, for without the slightest hesitation he insisted on my
not moving, and also on his putting me on a snow compress. In the mean
time it was decided that we should hurry on to Irkutsk, which was now
only some forty versts off, without any unnecessary delay. In spite,
however, of the cold compress, the pain in my foot, probably aggravated
by the movement of the sledge, increased to such an extent that I was in
positive agony when at last we came in sight of our destination, and the
many golden cupolas and minarets of the capital of Eastern Siberia stood
out clear and defined as a picture against the bright morning sky.

The scene was a beautiful one, and I could not help enjoying it in spite
of the acute pain I was suffering. Our road lay right across the frozen
river Angara, “the most beautiful river in the world,” as it has been
called. It was a Sunday morning, and crowds of gaily dressed peasants
on foot and in sledges were making their way towards the city in the
brilliant sunshine. The air resounded with the merry ring of sledge
bells, whilst the many quaint costumes and curious conveyances gave an
aspect of gaiety and life to a scene the like of which I had not yet
witnessed in Siberia. My only regret was that owing to my being unable
to move I could not get out of the sledge to make a sketch or take a
photograph. However, I promised myself not to lose sight of the subject,
and to return on the very first occasion when my foot would allow me. A
few minutes afterwards the driver drew up outside a large triumphal arch
standing at the entrance to the city and removed the duga bells before
passing through, as nowhere in Siberia are these allowed except on the
high-road.

My eight days’ tedious journey was at last ended, and it was with a
veritable feeling of relief that I found myself passing through the
broad, well-built streets, with the prospect of soon being once again in
a comfortable and well-appointed hotel.




CHAPTER XVI.

IRKUTSK.

    Unpleasant experiences at hotel—Hospitality of Mr. Charles
    Lee—First impressions of the city.


[Illustration: IRKUTSK.]

I was much disappointed to find, on reaching the principal hotel, the
_Moskovskaia Podvorié_, that its glories, of which I had heard so much,
were things of the past, and that as a hotel it no longer existed. True,
the imposing three-storied building still remained, but under a new
designation, for it is now the head-quarters of the Irkutsk military
staff, and is known as the Etat Major of the city. A few _chambres
meublées_ in the upper stories are all that remain of what was, two
years ago, the best hotel in Siberia. I afterwards learnt that its
failure was owing to its having been got up on far too grand a scale
for the place, and that its promoters had lost a “pot of money” over it
while it was open. Of course there were many other hotels, so I left the
matter in the hands of the yemschik, for my foot was so painful that I
felt absolutely indifferent as to where or how I was lodged, so long as
I could get out of the sledge and lie down quietly somewhere. But it was
evidently the height of the season in Irkutsk and the city crammed, for
everywhere I was told they were “full.” At last, however, after a lot of
driving about, I found a place where they had one room just vacant. It
was a really smart and imposing-looking hotel from outside, and quite a
“find,” as I imagined—till I got inside the building, when I found myself
in one of the dirtiest places of its kind I had yet seen in Siberia. The
contrast between the exterior and the interior was simply startling.
Much, however, as I was disgusted with it, I was so sick of hunting about
for lodgings that I determined to put up with it for a short time; at any
rate, till my foot was better. With the help of Matwieff I therefore made
myself as comfortable as I could on two chairs (for I did not like the
look of the sofa), and composed myself for “forty winks” whilst waiting
for the “something to eat” which I had ordered, for the accident to my
foot had not interfered with my appetite. But I found it impossible to
have a nap, on account of certain strange noises round the room. At first
I could not make out what they were occasioned by, but I soon discovered
after a slight inspection. The wall-paper, which was stretched over a
wooden foundation, did not touch the wood everywhere, and the curious
noise was produced by myriads of blackbeetles, cockroaches, and other
vermin running up and down the wall and in and out of holes they had
eaten in the paper. This cheerful discovery decided me at once to clear
out of the place, and chance finding something better elsewhere.

[Illustration: THE MOSKOVSKAIA PODVORIÉ, IRKUTSK.

[_To face p. 180._]

Suddenly an idea occurred to me. I had a letter of introduction to a Mr.
Charles Lee, an English engineer living in Irkutsk, a brother of the
unfortunate man who lost his life on our way up the Yenisei, so I sent
this letter to him, with a note telling him of my accident, and asking
if he could recommend me some other hotel to go to. My good luck had
not quite deserted me, for in a few minutes came back a message saying
he would himself be round to see me directly, and shortly after he
arrived. On seeing my helpless condition, this good Samaritan insisted
on my immediately leaving the hotel and going to stay at his house, to
be nursed till my foot was well; and, so as to ensure my not refusing,
he gave orders for my luggage to be forthwith removed. In a very short
time I was in a snug room, surrounded by every comfort; so, although the
doctor said I should have to remain indoors and not move for a week, I
felt that I should be in luck’s way if my lines were always cast in such
pleasant places. Under kind nursing my injured ankle got rapidly well, so
much so that I was soon able to get about again, and with the assistance,
though much against the wish, of my hospitable friend, find convenient
lodgings in the city. So it was a further proof of “all’s well that end’s
well.”

Containing forty thousand inhabitants, the capital of Eastern Siberia
covers an enormous extent of ground, being nearly two miles in each
direction—the principal street, or Bolshoi Oulitza, itself over a mile
in length. My first impressions on walking up this noble thoroughfare
were very different indeed from what I had anticipated, for it was hard
to realize how near one was to the Chinese frontier, and how far from
a railway; the whole scene was one of absolutely European character,
and reminded me not a little of many capitals I have visited. It was
quite a relief, after the desolate look of the streets at Krasnoiarsk
and Yeniseisk, owing to the apparent absence of shops, to see here
the handsome buildings with large plate-glass windows, in which were
displayed every description of European goods; and my surprise was the
more natural, for, from what I had read, I was led to believe that
nowhere in Siberia would I find the streets enlivened by the shop
displays which give so much life and character to a place. But what
astonished me most pleasantly in this far-away Siberian city was to see
the fair sex dressed in the very latest of Parisian fashions, for I saw
costumes in the Bolshoi Oulitza which would have looked smart even in
Bond Street or the Rue de la Paix, and, as added to which I don’t think I
was ever in a place which for its size could boast of more pretty faces,
the effect on a bright sunny afternoon may be imagined.

Irkutsk is not nearly so cold a place as Krasnoiarsk, for, according to
Keane, the mean winter temperature is _only_ minus 4 deg. Fahr., and the
summer temperature equal to that of Melbourne, and considerably higher
than that of Paris. Of course I was particularly fortunate in visiting
Irkutsk in the very height of the “season,” for, as is the case all over
Siberia, and, I believe, Russia also, the time to see “life” is during
the winter months, when the rich and fashionable classes are in town, and
all sorts of festivities are going on.

[Illustration: AN IRKUTSK BEAUTY.]

[Illustration: ENTRANCE HALL OF MILLIONAIRE GOLD-MINE OWNER’S HOUSE,
IRKUTSK.]

As at Krasnoiarsk, I found “society” here absolutely European in its
character, for most of the wealthiest people annually pass several months
in the West, so are quite _au courant_ with all that is going on in the
world of pleasure, and manage to convey their impressions back to their
Siberian palaces in the shape of luxuries and extravagances of every
sort. Amongst the many hospitalities I was shown I had the pleasure
of dining one evening at the house of Mr. Soukatchoff, the Mayor of
Irkutsk, one of the richest and most important men of the city. His
magnificent house, with its large picture-gallery (in which are over two
hundred and fifty examples of the best known of continental artists), its
immense library, and its priceless collection of curiosities from every
part of the world, made my visit to this gentleman a sort of “artistic
treat”—a treat which was in no way spoilt by the very excellent dinner
he gave us, and the interesting people I was introduced to, many of whom
spoke French and German fluently, and some of them English also. Here, as
elsewhere in Siberia, on every occasion when I have dined out, either in
Irkutsk, Krasnoiarsk, or Yeniseisk, the general “tone” and arrangements
were delightful. I was also fortunate enough to be present at a big
ball given by the millionaire, M. de Sievers, and I doubt very much
if the most brilliant “crush” of a London season could present a more
magnificent spectacle than did this ball—for the governor-general, with
his party, and the head-quarters staff officers, were present in full
uniform, blazing with orders and decorations, and the rooms were crowded
with as smart a crowd of people as the most fastidious London dancing
man could have desired. The “floor” and the music were both excellent.
In the gallery of the ball-room was stationed the regimental band,
while, by the fountain in the huge winter-garden, which was beautifully
illuminated with quaint Chinese lanterns, the town string-band played all
the evening. It was like being in dreamland to wander, with some pretty
girl on one’s arm, through the exotic shrubberies, and my thoughts were
carried far away from cold Siberia, to the sunny south of France and to
gay Monte Carlo. I should have been sorry to have missed seeing this
dance, for it did more towards giving me an insight into Irkutsk society
than all else.

[Illustration: STREET SCENE, IRKUTSK.]

Since the disastrous fire in Irkutsk in 1879, when almost the entire
town was burnt to the ground, it has been forbidden to build any but
stone or brick houses in the principal streets, so the result is
broad thoroughfares, with lofty buildings of imposing architectural
pretensions on either side, which would not disgrace any Western capital.
For its size, I do not think there is any city in the world which
can boast of more public institutions than Irkutsk. On first driving
through the city this was the characteristic feature which struck me,
for everywhere, almost in every street, was some important public
edifice, many of the institutions being, I was informed, the result of
private munificence. I had often read of these monuments as erected by
Siberian millionaires more to satisfy their personal vanity and love of
ostentation than out of any true charitable or public spirit—rather as
a means of proving to the vulgar horde what wealth they really possess.
Whether or no this is the case, of course it is impossible to say; but,
at any rate, the result is a conglomeration of public institutions which,
considering the size of the place, could not be rivalled anywhere,
I fancy. A brief list of them, in proof of my statement, may be of
interest, as giving an idea of the importance of this distant Siberian
city.

Of public schools there are no less than nineteen, all under the
supervision of a Government Educational Committee.

Then there are six hospitals—namely, three town hospitals; a foundling
hospital, on the usual Russian system; a military hospital, and a
madhouse.

Of “homes” for children there are at least four; three asylums for
the aged and infirm; a monastery for men and one for women; a convict
and a civil prison; a geographical institute; a large observatory
(with an English telescope); and two clubs—one military, the other for
merchants—making a total of over forty important public institutions for
a population of less than forty thousand.

Of the handsome churches, of which there are no less than twenty-two,
besides two cathedrals, many were also presented to this lucky city
by its millionaire inhabitants, who, when they decide to spend their
money, do so in no parsimonious manner, as is evidenced by the result.
The monastery of St. Innocent, a short distance from the city, is as
beautiful a specimen of Italian architecture as one could see anywhere,
and cost its donors, several rich merchants, I don’t know how many
million roubles. It is not only in Irkutsk, however, that one finds such
proofs of great private munificence, for I learn that the magnificent
cathedral of Krasnoiarsk was presented to the city by a rich man who made
his millions out of vodka!

Irkutsk, being the seat of the Government of Eastern Siberia (a district
equal in size to the half of Europe), is naturally well stocked with
officials of all sorts and grades, the governor-general and civil
governor having each no less than three _remplaçants_. Considering what
an important centre Irkutsk is, I was surprised to learn that it was only
garrisoned by one battalion of 1000 soldiers and one _sotnia_ (nominally
100, but actually 150) of Cossacks; so the energies of the military
governor are not overtaxed. The Chinese frontier district comes within
the government of the Trans-Baikal and Amour provinces.

[_To face p. 191._]

The police arrangements struck me as being particularly good. In the
daytime mounted men are continually patrolling the streets to prevent
any congestion of the traffic—a very necessary measure, considering the
reckless manner in which Siberians drive. At night there is a curious and
truly Eastern custom still in vogue in this important city; watchmen
parade the streets, continually agitating a peculiar sort of knocker
which emits a sound not unlike that of the rattle our policemen used
to be provided with. What is the reason of adhering to this primitive
custom I have been unable to learn. Perhaps Siberian thieves are known
to be nervous, and this arrangement frightens them, and deters them from
contemplated misdeeds. Certainly the watchmen themselves would not have
that effect on anything but a very old woman or a young child, for they
were usually aged and decrepit fellows, who looked as though they ought
to have been at home and in bed instead of out all night. Fortunately the
Irkutsk streets are safe enough during the dark hours.

CHAPTER XVII.

PRISON LIFE IN SIBERIA—_continued_.

    The Irkutsk prison—Comparative liberty of
    prisoners—Incongruities of prison life—The “shops”—Prison
    artists.


[Illustration: THE RECREATION GROUND, IRKUTSK PRISON.]

There was always so much to see and do in Irkutsk, that the five weeks I
spent there were fully occupied. The prison life of Siberia has always
interested me highly, for I had read so much of it before coming to the
country that I never missed an opportunity of seeing as much of it as
possible. One of my first excursions, therefore, was to the gaol here. As
at Yeniseisk and Krasnoiarsk, the officials were politeness itself, and
although the _ostrog_ here is a really important one, containing as it
does no less than twelve hundred prisoners (owing to the recent burning
of the Alexandroffsky prison), I experienced not the slightest difficulty
in being shown all there was to be seen. The authorities offered me every
assistance in their power, and no secret whatever was made of it; the
governor-general of Irkutsk, to whom my mission as a special artist and
correspondent was well known, even going so far as to send me a courteous
message, saying that he would be pleased to let me see all I wished of
the prison life, and hoped that I would only write the exact truth about
it! So I spent a long morning there, walking round with the director, the
doctor, and other officials, and saw and sketched as much as I wished,
and only had to ask to be told all I wanted to know.

[Illustration: MARRIED PRISONERS WAITING TO BE SERVED WITH NEW CLOTHES ON
ARRIVAL AT THE PRISON AT IRKUTSK.

[_To face p. 193_]

What struck me most in the internal arrangements was the comparative
liberty that existed inside the vast building; for, with the exception
of a few prisoners in solitary confinement, all seemed free to roam
about in the corridors or the large quadrangle to their hearts’ content;
and although a warder with a large bunch of keys accompanied us on our
round, in no case did he find occasion to use them, for all the doors
were unlocked. I was informed that it is only at night the prisoners are
locked in. The system is certainly a curious one. Of course the men in
the “solitary” cells were not allowed this sort of liberty.

The description I have given of the Yeniseisk prison will almost suffice
for the Irkutsk one as well, with the exception that the various
“halls,” or “dormitories,” there were infinitely better than those
here, which—probably on account of their overcrowded state—were in a
filthy condition, and little better than human pigsties. Every spot was
occupied, and the stench was awful in consequence, for this is an old
prison as compared with that at Yeniseisk. I was much astonished to see
dogs, cats, and even pigeons and doves in some “halls,” and on inquiry
was informed that prisoners are allowed their “pets,” and that each
crowd had its special and distinctive favourites, fed out of the general
“mess”! It was quite touching to see some hulking ruffian loafing about
in the sunshine with a tiny kitten in his arms, or to hear the cooing
of turtle-doves in some gloomy recess of a filthy cell. Although these
incongruities of prison life struck me as being very extraordinary, they
passed unnoticed by my companions, who were surprised when I drew their
attention to them and observed how much more severe the English prison
system is.

After going the round of the “halls” we next visited the workshops. As
I told you in a previous chapter, work in a Siberian prison is purely
optional; a man can be as lazy as he likes, or else he can set to
and earn a little money at his particular trade, if he has one, and
such work is required. There are two kinds of work permitted by the
Government—work in the prison itself in the various workshops provided
for the different trades, and outdoor work away from the prison. In the
Irkutsk prison almost every trade was not only represented but well
employed also, for in many of the workshops I was informed the men were
so busy with orders on hand that for the moment they could undertake no
more. All the work being carried out was for townspeople. Of the money
thus earned, a certain percentage goes to the Government, and the rest is
divided equally among the men of the atelier.

We visited all the “shops,” and it was quite refreshing to see the
men hard at work, and working cheerfully together—as well they might,
considering that it is to their mutual advantage to do so. They were
working evidently under no restraint whatever, for I noticed no guards
about. I was told that one could get almost anything made here—for in
the “shops” were tailors, hatters, bootmakers, smiths, locksmiths,
carpenters, cabinet-makers, cigarette-makers, jewellers, engravers, and
even artists; for in the prison, at the time I visited it, were two
men convicted of uttering false banknotes, and who, having artistic
proclivities, passed their time in painting—the one, portraits from
photographs; the other, _bons Dieux_, or the sacred pictures so dear to
the Greek Church. I saw the portrait-painter at work in the same room
as the cigarette-makers, and much out of place here did the easel and
canvas look, almost as much so as the artist himself, in his prison garb,
with a large palette and bunch of brushes and mahl-stick in his hand. The
fellow spoke German fluently, so we had a talk together, as he was not
at all reticent, and did not seem to feel his position a little bit. He
informed me that he always had as much work to do as he could possibly
get through, so he never found the time hang heavily on his hands. This
work—which, by the way, was very indifferent—I further learnt, was mostly
for local photographers.

The other “artist,” whom we subsequently visited, was quite a “swell,”
for he was in solitary confinement, and had been permitted to fit up
his small cell quite as a studio. There were shelves on the walls full
of half-completed pictures, a lot of the usual paraphernalia of art lay
about, while in one corner hung a large framed oil-painting, a copy
of a celebrated picture I knew well through the recently published
photogravures of it in London—a beautiful composition, and looking
strangely incongruous in so gruesome and dismal a place, for the only
light entered by a small, heavily grated window high up near the ceiling.
This gentleman, who seemed quite as busy as the portrait-painter, was,
however, quite a different character, and as reticent and moody as the
other was talkative, for when the director asked him if he did not speak
French or German so that I could ask him a few questions, he curtly
replied that he had forgotten whether he ever did or not, for he was now
a “number,” no longer a man. I afterwards learnt that both these men,
though convicted, were not as yet sentenced, and that probably they would
be sent for an indefinite number of years to hard labour in one of the
Government mines, and that it was only pending their sentence that they
were allowed to go on with their painting, though, my informant added,
with a smile, they would probably be able to do a little even at the
mines if they behaved themselves!

With so much labour of all sorts to be got almost for the asking, it
may be imagined how _exploitée_ the prison is by local tradesmen, who
thus get their work done by these “unfortunates” at probably less than a
third of what it would cost them if they employed town labour. I got a
large double brass seal made, and engraved at both ends, for less than
2_s._ 6_d._, and then, when it was finished, the governor ordered the
prisoner who had made it to engrave my initials on my stick into the
bargain, which the fellow did without a word of grumbling. He looked
very grateful, however, when I slipped a few extra kopeks into his hand
afterwards.

The forged banknote which I give in facsimile was the work of a prison
artist. All its elaborate pen-and-ink work represents when complete only
the sum of five roubles (10_s._). Yet for this small amount a long term
of imprisonment was risked! (and got).

PRISON LIFE IN SIBERIA—_continued_.

    Outdoor employment of prisoners—A chat with an employer of
    convict labour—The “convict’s word”—An interview with a
    celebrated murderess—The criminal madhouse—Political prisoners
    in solitary confinement—I get permission to paint a picture in
    one of the cells—End of my visits to the prison.


[Illustration]

Outdoor employment away from the prison is often granted to prisoners who
have been remarked for special good conduct, and they are drafted off
either to Government or private works, such as salt or iron workings.
Those sent to private works are thus rewarded for exceptionally good
behaviour whilst in prison; they get well paid whilst thus employed,
and they work side by side with free men, receiving the same pay, and
enjoying the same allowances, the only difference being that of course
they cannot leave of their own accord. The pay struck me as being
exceptionally good, for it averages twenty-five roubles (£3) per month
for foremen, and ranging down to four roubles for ordinary labourers.
Besides this pay each man receives eighty pounds of flour for himself,
and if married forty for his wife, and the same amount for each child
from the day of its birth till it is thirteen years of age. Eight roubles
per year are also allowed for boots and gloves. Housing is provided by
the owners of the works, but the convicts may if they choose live apart
on the works at their own expense. At the Government works (not the
hard-labour ones) it is very different, for although it is a distinct
rise in the prisoner’s position to be sent to them, the pay is very poor
indeed, being only five kopeks (a little over one penny) per day, and
the men are always under the supervision of convoy soldiers. There is no
military guard over men working at private works.

I had an interesting interview with the owner of some salt works who
largely employs convict labour. He told me that he would far rather
employ convicts than ordinary labourers, as they were “more reliable.”
If a convict gave his “convict’s word” to do or not to do a thing, as
the case might be, he could rely on his never breaking it, for it would
be contrary to the recognized code of prison honour. For instance, he
told me, it would often happen, when the gang he had ordered arrived,
the _staroster_ of it would inform him that such and such prisoners were
unreliable, as they had declared their intention of running away at the
first opportunity. “But how about the others?” he would ask; “for it
would be awkward to find one’s self shorthanded at a critical moment.”
“Oh, the others,” would reply the _staroster_, “have given me their
‘convict’s word’ to remain and do their best, so you can rely on them.”
This system of thus utilizing convict labour is undoubtedly part of a
huge scheme for gradually colonizing this vast continent, as round the
works small villages gradually spring up.

After visiting the men’s quarters we went to the portion reserved for the
fair sex, which, beyond being very crowded, offered but little of novelty
or interest. Just as we were turning to leave the building, however, the
doctor said, “Let’s go and see how the baroness is;” so we went back and
down a corridor, at the end of which was a door by itself. Before going
in I was informed that this was the cell of the famous poisoner, Sofie de
Willup, Baroness de Sachs, whose trial, with that of her lover, a groom,
some years ago in St. Petersburg, for murdering her second husband by
slow poison, was a _cause célèbre_, for it then transpired that her first
husband had also died in some mysterious manner. The case was proved to
the hilt, I was told, and in England her fate, the gallows, would have
been inevitable; but in Russia it was different, for she was a scion
of a noble and wealthy house, and her relatives moving in the highest
circles. Still, she could not entirely escape punishment of some sort,
and she was eventually sent to Siberia for life, nominally to “hard
labour at the mines,” where a poor and unknown woman would undoubtedly
have gone; but the governor of the province she was consigned to was
a relative of hers, so she naturally never reached her destination,
but remained in the Irkutsk prison as “an invalid.” Her lover, being
a nobody, was sent to work in chains for the remainder of his life in
Saghalien, and is doubtless there still.

[Illustration: THE BARONESS.]

In response to a discreet knock by the governor, a female voice from
within bade us enter. Imagine my astonishment, after having been told
all the lady was, to find myself in a small but comfortably furnished
room, with flowers and birds in cages in the window, and books and other
“luxuries” lying about in profusion; whilst in a cupboard I noticed
the usual extensive wardrobe of a stylish woman. On a carved bedstead
in one corner of this unique prison “cell” lay the invalid, a healthy,
not unprepossessing young woman of about thirty years of age; she was
dressed in ordinary walking costume, and on hearing our knock had
evidently hastily thrown herself on the bed and covered herself with a
smart travelling rug, so as to carry out fully her invalid condition.
The whole look of the place was certainly the most hollow mockery of
justice I had ever seen, and I could not help involuntarily contrasting
her surroundings with those of the poor wretches in other parts of
the building, whose crimes were probably not half as bad as hers. The
lady languidly gave us her hand to shake, and in reply to the doctor’s
question as to how “Madame la baronne” felt, said she felt a little
better.

“By the way,” said the governor, “you speak English, or French, or
German, don’t you, Baronne?”

“Oh yes,” she replied, “all three.”

So I was formally introduced, and had my first conversation with a
real live murderess. It was rather embarrassing at the commencement,
for I hardly knew what to say; but she helped me out of the difficulty
by asking in very fair English how dear old London looked, and how
long it was since I had left it, etc., and we ended by having quite
a cosmopolitan chat together, first in English, then in French, and
gradually drifting into German, as, so to speak, we wandered about
Europe, talking of the different places we knew, whilst I meanwhile was
making a rough sketch of the room and its occupant. She told me, to my
surprise, that she hoped to be free in a couple of months, when, although
she would not be allowed to leave Siberia, she could live on her means
(which, I believe, were ample) in some designated village or town. “After
six years of ‘prison’ life,” she added, “any place will be an agreeable
change for me.”

On leaving the baroness the doctor suggested that the criminal madhouse
might interest me, so we all adjourned to a neighbouring building
standing within a high stockade. The unfortunate inmates were evidently
well looked after, for the place was as warm as toast and as clean as
possible. There were no dangerous madmen there when we visited it, so the
padded rooms were empty. It gave one more the impression of a hospital
than a madhouse. As we entered, a wretched-looking little individual
rushed up to the director and loudly complained about his being still
detained there because the governor-general of Irkutsk refused to pay him
what he owed him. The director agreed with him that it was very unfair
his being there under the circumstances, but assured him that the matter
was receiving the attention it deserved, and doubtless in a few days he
would be permitted to leave. This seemed to satisfy the poor fellow,
and he withdrew, after thanking us all for having honoured him with our
visit.

In another of the wards amongst the patients was an actor (absurdly like
Willard). Immediately he caught sight of us he ran up to the doctor, and
in excited tones informed him that he had not yet received the thirty
thousand roubles, which were owing to him for his last performance. The
doctor pacified him with the assurance that the money would shortly
be forthcoming, but had not yet been received by the officials, and
further, to humour him, asked how the performance for his “benefit” was
progressing. In reply, the fellow gave us, in the centre of the room,
what evidently was part of a scene he had once acted in, and went through
some extraordinary performance, alternately weeping, tearing his hair,
and grovelling on the floor, whilst uttering incoherent sentences,
and then rushing about as though with a sword in his hand and singing
operatic airs. It was a painful rather than an amusing sight, and one
which I shall not easily forget—the poor half-witted chap in the centre
of the large room declaiming to an imaginary audience, and all round,
sitting or standing by their beds, were the other lunatics, watching his
movements in rapt amazement.

[Illustration: A “POLITICAL.”

(_From a Government photo._)

[_To face p. 205._]

We then went back to the prison, as I expressed a wish to see the
prisoners in the solitary, or _sekrétene_, cells. This was the only part
of the building which was really like a prison. And very gloomy and
depressing was it; no less than three heavily barred iron doors had
to be unlocked before we reached the corridor where these cells were
situated. A warder is on duty here, I was told, night and day, for there
were several political prisoners, and the rest were the most desperate
characters. In each door was a little hole about the size of a sixpence,
through which could be seen the interior of the cell. I had a peep into
all; it was almost like looking at some caged wild beasts, the clanking
of the heavy chains they wore on their hands and feet heightening the
illusion. Some of the prisoners had, I was informed, been there for
years, and only were allowed out for exercise for an hour a day, and
were not permitted to mingle with the other prisoners. It was easy to
distinguish which were the “politicals,” for they were in ordinary
civilian costume and had no chains on, as far as I could see. Most of
them were quite young men, one being a mere lad, his curly hair and
good-looking face not giving him the appearance of being so dangerous a
political character as to necessitate such elaborate precautions being
taken to prevent his escape. To my astonishment—for I had always read
to the contrary—I noticed that all these political prisoners were not
only allowed books to read, but in most cases were smoking also, and in
every instance had their own mattresses and bedding; so their cells, at
any rate, looked cleaner and more cheerful than those of the ordinary
criminals, to whom filth seemed indifferent.

As we were crossing the quadrangle on our way out, a prisoner came up
and offered to sell me a horsehair chain he had made. The fact of the
governor and other officials being present did not seem to matter a bit,
so as the work was curious I bought it of him, and as I had no small
money about me, he took a rouble note and went and got change from some
other prisoner!

This my first visit to the prison was followed by many others, and I made
a heap of sketches; in fact, I fancy I got to be looked upon as quite
an _habitué_ of the gruesome place. I even obtained permission to make
a painting of a prisoner in one of the solitary cells, and had a whole
day’s work at it under the supervision of a warder, a break in the poor
wretch’s awful existence which he will probably remember for many a long
year, whilst probably wondering what the _Angliski Gospodin_ could have
seen worthy of being painted in so dreary a place.

On the morning of my last visit to the prison, when I went to fetch away
my canvas and paint-box, I was rather surprised to notice as I drove up
a tall, well-dressed woman walking up and down, accompanied by a gaoler,
in the sunshine, outside the gates, in front of the group of warders
and soldiers who were always lolling about smoking and chatting on the
benches against the wall. On getting nearer, I found it was my murderess
friend the baroness. We shook hands in the most unconstrained manner, and
she told me in French that she was taking her usual “constitutional”
after breakfast. We then had quite a long talk together, for she had
news to give me. In a month she would be free again, and was going to
live at a little place called Oussolié, near Irkutsk, where she intended
building a house for herself. She then told me a lot more about her
future plans—I almost felt inclined to ask if they included any more
husbands! Whilst thus chatting, the warders in no way interfered with
us; they did not seem to consider it in any way strange my speaking to a
prisoner. Before leaving her she said she would be glad to write to me if
I ever cared to hear from her, and would also send her photo if I liked.
My murderess friend was evidently “smitten”! I gave her my address, and,
to my surprise, a few days later received the letter, of which I give a
facsimile, and also enclosing her photo, which I afterwards learnt she
had had taken expressly for me. With this somewhat novel adventure ended
my visits to the prison.




CHAPTER XIX.

IRKUTSK—_continued_.

    A gold-caravan—Particulars as to the gold-mining industry of
    Siberia—The Foundling Hospital—The fire-brigade—Celebration of
    the Czar’s birthday—Living in Irkutsk.


[Illustration: THE HIGH STREET, IRKUTSK.]

While driving outside the city one day I met a most curious-looking
procession. It consisted of twelve covered sledges nearly all exactly
of the same pattern, with numbers written on them, and the leading and
hindmost ones with large lanterns fixed on the roof; in several of them
I noticed were soldiers with rifles in readiness. The effect was so
peculiar that on my return I made it my business to find out what it was
all about. I was informed that what I had seen was a “gold-caravan” _en
route_ for Russia. My informant then, in reply to my questions, gave me a
lot of interesting particulars about the gold-mining industry of Siberia
which was quite new to me, and will doubtless be of interest to others.
He told me that all gold found in Siberia has to be sold immediately to
the Government, who buys it at the current price of St. Petersburg. A
mine-owner is not permitted to sell to a private individual, nor even
to have the smallest amount in his possession beyond a certain time.
If he should desire to keep a small nugget, say, as a curiosity, he
must _buy_ it from the Government, who will then give him a special
permit authorizing him its possession. All gold has to be delivered
at the owner’s expense at the Government smelting-houses, where it is
made into ingots and then sent by caravan to St. Petersburg, the cost
of smelting and carriage being also charged to the owner. The primary
charges are, therefore, somewhat considerable. Gold is sold at per
“pood,” a pood being equivalent to thirty-six pounds English. At the then
rate of exchange, a pood was worth 15,616 roubles (8 rs. 40 kopeks =
£1, February, 1891); out of this must be deducted the cost of transport
(usually per post) to the smelting-house, which is considerable, and
the further cost per caravan and rail to St. Petersburg, which amounts
to forty roubles per pood. The Government keeps back for assaying,
smelting, etc., 416 roubles per pood on all gold from the Lena mines, and
132 roubles in gold sent from the Amour district. I naturally asked the
reason of the great difference in the charges against the two districts,
and was told that in the Amour district, where only the width of the
river separates the Russian from the Chinese empire, the temptation to
sell the gold across the frontier would be very great were the Russian
Government duties excessive; so it is for that reason they are so much
reduced. The Lena mines are too far away for anything of the sort to be
feared.

Through the courtesy of the officials I was enabled to spend a very
interesting morning at the Government smelting-house, and witnessed
several operations, to me very novel, from the unpacking of the gold as
it is received from the mine-owners, its weighing, smelting, and eventual
running off into ingots. Over £10,000 worth of gold was operated on, so I
had a good opportunity of seeing the entire _modus operandi_. I noticed,
by the way, that all the assaying instruments were English, and by a
London maker. Afterwards I was shown, in the “safe,” ingots to the amount
of nearly half a million (£500,000), some of them so heavy that I could
hardly lift them, all of which had the owner’s mark on them, with date,
weight, etc.

An enormous quantity of gold annually leaves Siberia for St. Petersburg.
Last year, I am informed, the weight amounted to 1295 poods, or 46,620
lbs. Each caravan, such as the one I had seen, by which it is sent as
far as the railway at Tiumen, consists of twelve sledges or tarantasses,
according to the season, and is accompanied by two officers and six
soldiers, which is certainly not a big guard, considering the immense
value of their charge, for each conveyance contains 25 poods (or 900 lbs.
of solid gold), so the entire caravan carries no less than 10,800 lbs. of
the precious metal.

To my surprise, I learnt that no Siberian goldsmith is allowed to buy
or work in gold, the penalty for breaking this law being very severe.
In spite, however, of these regulations, I hear that a lot of illicit
gold-buying and even goldsmith’s work exists; for, as is always the case
when such stringent precautions are taken, there are weak points in the
law, which serve as loopholes to the many people whose consciences do
not prick them, with the result that a deal of Siberian gold crosses the
frontier into China, where it finds a ready market.

Amongst the many imposing buildings in the city there was one which
struck me as being particularly fine. On inquiry I was informed that it
was the Foundling Hospital (_Vospititelni Dom_). I had read so much
about these unique Russian institutions, that my curiosity was aroused.
Without any difficulty whatever I obtained permission to visit it, and
I was very much interested in all I was shown, for I had never seen
anything of the kind before. It was, of course, a _replica_ on a smaller
scale of the colossal institutions of the kind in St. Petersburg and
Moscow and other Russian cities, which are so ably described in “Murray.”
As their _raison d’être_ may not be generally known, a few extracts from
the work just named may be of interest.

In speaking of these hospitals at St. Petersburg and Moscow he says—

    “The fate of illegitimate children and the responsibilities of
    their parents have been, and in all probability will remain,
    one of the most difficult subjects for legislation in most
    countries. But though some laws regarding it are necessary,
    there can be no question that natural affection, nay, even
    common humanity, should inculcate upon those who can possibly
    raise the means the duty of bringing them up at their own
    expense. The facilities afforded by this hospital militate, we
    think, against this principle....

    “We cannot help thinking that a visit to this remarkable
    establishment [the St. Petersburg one] cannot fail to excite
    very serious reflections in the mind of the English traveller.
    If the institution is to be viewed in the light of a charity,
    it is charity upon a very questionable principle; but be this
    as it may, this vast breeding-cage will give visitors a very
    clear idea of the power and immense resources of the State....
    Though this is called a foundling hospital, it is in reality a
    general receptacle for all children, who are received up to a
    certain age without exception, it being entirely left to the
    option of the parents to state their names and conditions, and
    to contribute or not to the future support of the child.... If
    a boy be left by his parents without any accompanying deposit,
    he is brought up for the army, and, unless he displays very
    unusual mental powers, is destined for life to serve as a
    common soldier; if, on the contrary, a certain sum is left with
    him, he will become an officer. Thus the boys brought up in
    this institution become in all cases the property of the State,
    and furnish a constant supply of recruits for the various
    gradations of military service.... The majority of the girls,
    beyond a common and useful education in their own language, are
    employed solely in manual labour, the produce of which goes
    partly to the funds of the institution and is partly put by for
    them, to form their marriage portion.”

I do not think I was ever in a cleaner-looking place than the Irkutsk
Foundling Hospital. The floors actually rivalled the walls in whiteness,
and the neat costume worn by the wet-nurses enhanced an effect which was
as pretty as it was unique. Each nurse, I was informed, has charge of two
infants, and I noticed in several instances the woman walking about with
the two babies at the same time, one on each arm. Considering how many
children there were in the place, the rooms were remarkably quiet, for I
had quite expected to hear the usual deafening “nursery row” going on—a
row which, though doubtless very amusing to mothers and nurses, never had
much attraction for me. There was nothing particularly striking about the
interior of the building, which consisted of several very large and lofty
rooms; in the centre of each of these, which probably contained about six
cots, was a sort of high table or desk with a ledge round it, and on
which the babies were dressed, or, rather, tightly packed up in swaddling
clothes—a curious process which gave them the appearance of miniature
mummies all exactly of the same pattern, for the rolling always seemed
done on a sort of systematic principle. I was much astonished to learn
that many of the wet-nurses were the mothers of the children they were
nursing, for they are often so appointed if they wish it, when there is
no reason to the contrary. The infants are usually kept in the hospital
for about six weeks, and are then sent out to nurse amongst the peasants
round about, for which a small monthly sum is paid by the institution;
and then when they reach a certain age,

    “About six years old, they are taken from their foster parents
    [what a parting this must be to thousands every year!], the
    girls to St. Petersburg for their education, and the boys to a
    branch establishment at Gatshina” (Murray).

Of course the Irkutsk foundlings are brought up and remain in Siberia.

Amongst the many other charitable institutions here, I also visited one
of the children’s homes (_dedski prioutt_), where orphans of both sexes
are received up to a certain age, and educated and brought up free. Also
the “Home” for the aged and infirm who, through no fault of their own,
find themselves stranded at the end of their lives—a “Home” unique in its
way, being neither a workhouse nor an almshouse as we understand it in
England. What most impressed me in these institutions was the marvellous
cleanliness and order which existed everywhere.

[Illustration: IN THE COURTYARD OF A FIRE STATION, IRKUTSK.]

The fire-brigade is quite a big affair here, as well it may be after the
terrible experiences of the inhabitants in 1879, and, as is the case
in all Siberian cities, large watch-towers are placed in all the most
prominent positions, from which watchmen can discern any outbreak, and
then give the alarm by means of a big bell; whilst in the stations below
the men, horses, manuals, and water-carts are in constant readiness,
and can turn out in wonderfully short time—in fact, so smart are they,
that had I not seen a proof of it on one occasion, I could hardly have
believed it possible to harness the horses and get away so quickly. There
is a steam fire-engine at Irkutsk, and I was gratified to note that it
was by an English firm, Shand and Mason. Very proud the men seem of it,
too, for it shone all over like a looking-glass, and is evidently kept
in tip-top condition. In this distant Siberian city its familiar form
seemed like a connecting-link with far-away London.

I was much struck with the number of overhead wires one sees in Irkutsk,
and on inquiry learnt they were mostly telephone wires, and that all the
Government offices and most of the big business houses are connected by
this means. The wires are worked by a private company, and the charges
are not excessive considering, the cost per year, including hire and
fixing of machine, etc., being only twenty-five roubles (£3). Irkutsk is
also in direct communication with a St. Petersburg Central News Agency,
and every item of news of importance is received here by telegram as
soon as it is known at the Russian office. In this way I learnt of the
last Whitechapel murder on the very evening of the day it had occurred,
for everybody at the club was talking of it, such an impression did it
make even right away here in the centre of Asia. Talking of clubs, there
are two really well-arranged ones here, one a military, the other a
merchants’, though neither of them can come up to the one at Krasnoiarsk
in my opinion.

The museum, which I visited one morning, well repaid me for the couple of
hours I spent there, for the five rooms contain, besides many valuable
specimens of Siberian and Mongolian curiosities and mammoth bones, a
complete stuffed collection of Siberian animals and birds. The rooms
are also used for the periodical meetings of the St. Petersburg Imperial
Geographical Society, of which Irkutsk is the Eastern Siberian section.

As far as outdoor amusement is concerned, the principal place during the
winter months is the skating-rink, in the principal street, which is
the favourite resort of the _jeunesse dorée_ here, and from four till
six of an afternoon the ice is generally crowded with pretty girls and
smart-looking officers and civilians, most of them excellent skaters.
A band, which plays twice a week, and fireworks and illuminations on
certain evenings, add also considerably to its attractions. Beyond the
clubs there is very little in the way of public amusements, for the
only theatre was burnt down two years ago and has not yet been rebuilt,
although it is proposed to do so shortly on a magnificent scale.
Meanwhile, amateur dramatic performances occasionally take place in a
large hall transformed for the nonce into a short of theatre. I was
present at one of these “performances,” and although I understood but
very little of what was said, I could not help coming to the conclusion
that Irkutsk is not bubbling over with amateur histrionic talent, for the
show was very tame and uninteresting.

[Illustration: THE GOVERNOR-GENERAL’S HOUSE, IRKUTSK.]

It is said that in Russia at least one-half of the year is given up to
religious or other holidays, and I can quite believe it, for scarcely
a week passed without a _prasnik_ of some sort occurring during it;
so much so that my astonishment is that any business can be carried on
successfully with such continuous interruptions; for on these holidays
all the shops are closed, and nothing whatever goes on all day except
church-bell ringing and subsequent parading of the streets by the
townspeople in their well-used holiday attire. The most important of all
these _fêtes_ occurred whilst I was in Irkutsk, March 10 (February 26,
Old Style), being the anniversary of the Czar’s birthday. The city was
gaily decorated for the occasion, and as it was quite a warm spring-like
day the streets were thronged with people, and presented a most animated
appearance. After the customary thanksgiving service in the different
churches, a royal salute was fired, and a parade of the garrison took
place in front of the cathedral, in the presence of the governor-general
and his staff. The troops, who were without their rifles, performed
several evolutions with a smartness which quite surprised me, for,
although undoubtedly a serviceable-looking lot of men, they had never
given me the impression of having any smartness in them. After marching
past, first in quarter column and then double column of companies, they
were formed up in line, the wheeling being remarkably steady, and the
proceedings ended with a cheer for his most holy Majesty the Czar of all
the Russias. One sees so little of the military in Siberia, except when
they are off duty, that it is seldom one has an opportunity of judging
what “stuff” they are made of.

Living in Irkutsk is not cheap—rather the reverse, I thought, after my
Krasnoiarsk and Yeniseisk experiences—for, in spite of rent, food, and
labour being as cheap as anywhere else in Siberia, the charges at all
the hotels were as high as they would have been anywhere in Europe.
One could understand it if everything had to be brought from a great
distance; but considering that Irkutsk is the centre of a huge producing
district, it ought to be one of the cheapest places to live in rather
than the contrary. Still, it is a city well worth seeing, and had I not
visited it I should certainly have missed the real “life” of Siberia.

CHAPTER XX.

FROM IRKUTSK TO THE MONGOL CHINESE FRONTIER.

    My journey to Kiakhta, the city of the tea princes—Across Lake
    Baikal on the ice—Interesting experiences.


[Illustration: A BIT ON THE ROAD TO LAKE BAIKAL.]

The weather was beginning to get so warm and the snow so rapidly
disappearing that I made up my mind to continue my route to the frontier
without delay, as I was anxious to cross Lake Baikal on the ice whilst
there was still the opportunity. True, I had been informed that there was
really no necessity to hurry, that it could often be crossed thus even
as late as May; but such opportunities were doubtless exceptional, and
this year the season showed every sign of being an early one, so I felt
there was no time to be lost if I wished to see this vast inland sea in
its winter garb, and I had heard so much about the wondrous beauties of
this enormous expanse of ice and the novel experiences of the journey
across, that I decided not to remain any longer in Irkutsk, but to push
on to Kiakhta, the frontier city, and finish up my work there. Moreover,
I had very positive confirmation of my views, for shortly after the news
reached us that the ice on the Angara river had commenced to break up,
and that for many miles the river was already clear.

I now learnt that I could not go the whole way from Irkutsk to Kiakhta
by sledge, as the snow always ends some miles before the frontier is
reached, and the remainder of the journey has to be made in a conveyance
on wheels. I was advised, therefore, to do the snow-covered part of the
road on a cheap, open sledge, which I could sell for a few roubles at
the last post-house. So my big sledge, in which I had travelled so many
thousand versts, had to be disposed of, and I was fortunate enough to
find an enterprising dealer who took it off my hands at a fair price,
probably on the off-chance of making a good thing out of it next winter.
My next concern was to buy the cheap open sledge for the journey; this
I had no difficulty in procuring, and for eight roubles (less than £1)
I got a big, awkward-looking vehicle, not unlike a huge clothes-basket
covered with sacking—a great contrast to the luxurious pavoska I had
hitherto been travelling in. Still, it was in itself a welcome sign that,
for me, the long Siberian winter was nearly past, and that I was soon to
be _en route_ for the sunny South.

My preparations did not take long, for the journey to Kiakhta only
occupies two days, and on the evening of March 11 I left the gay capital
of Eastern Siberia for the Mongol frontier. I had been advised to start
at night, so as to reach the lake—which is only sixty versts off—early in
the morning, and accomplish the crossing by daylight. I had not thought
it necessary to hamper myself with a servant for so short a journey, so
was travelling quite alone.

For many miles after leaving the city the road lay along the ice in the
very centre of the river Angara, and as it was quite a warm evening
and the track very smooth, the motion was so pleasant that the idea of
perchance the road ending abruptly never entered my head, and it was
quite with a feeling of regret that I saw the horses at last turned
towards the bank and we were on land once more. But only by the wildest
stretch of the imagination could it have been considered a sledge-track,
my driver having actually to search for bits of snow here and there, and
make for them as well as he could across the intervening mud; in fact,
it seemed absurd attempting it in a sledge. However, we managed somehow
to reach the first station, and found the yard full of _tarantasses_
(the summer posting carriages, which I shall have occasion to describe
further on), which had just arrived with travellers bound for Irkutsk; my
sledge looking strangely out of place among the tall, unwieldy vehicles.
The postmaster shook his head, and said he very much doubted whether he
ought to let me proceed, except on wheels; eventually he only let me have
horses on condition that I did not start till just before daybreak, so as
to reach the bad part when it was light. I shall long remember that “bad
part,” for I don’t think I was ever on such a road before in my life,
even in a wheeled carriage, and certainly hope never to be on such a one
again in a sledge. Many times I got out and tramped along in the mud out
of sheer compassion for the horses, who were “pulling their hearts out”
to get the unwieldy sledge through the awful quagmire, for it was nothing
else.

It was a lovely morning, with every promise of another spring-like day,
when we once more sighted the river Angara. But to my astonishment, this
was no silent expanse of ice as when I had seen it on the previous night,
for before me was a broad, swiftly running river, its clear limpid waters
sparkling like crystal in the bright rays of the rising sun, while on its
surface no trace of ice could I discern.

[Illustration: THE RIVER ANGARA NEAR LAKE BAIKAL.]

It was a beautiful and impressive scene, though positively startling
withal, to see a moving river once more after the dreary ice-bound wastes
one had got accustomed to look at during the past four months, and I
could scarcely realize that this was the same river along which I had
travelled on the ice so few miles back. The Angara here must have been
at least as wide as the Thames at London Bridge, the opposite banks,
which were clothed with dense pine forests, rising precipitously from
the very edge of the water. On account of the pureness of the atmosphere
everything appeared so much nearer than it really was, that at first I
could hardly believe that what I took to be curious little bushes on the
opposite side were in reality big full-grown trees. I could not help
thinking that if the scene is so weirdly beautiful even during the winter
months, what must it be when all these grand hills are clothed with the
gorgeous verdure of an Asiatic summer? Then indeed must the effect be
almost of surpassing beauty, and one which must fully justify its title
of “the most beautiful river in the world.” Considering the importance of
the Angara, its resources are undoubtedly as yet in their infancy, for
this mighty river is the only outlet of the waters of Lake Baikal, being,
curiously enough, the only river which flows _out of it_, and is, as may
be seen by a glance at the map, the big connecting link of the whole of
the huge watershed of Central Asia—a watershed so vast and extended that
in comparison with it that of the Mississippi and Missouri pales into
insignificance.

Unfortunately, however, there is an impediment to the entire utilization
of this great waterway which up to the present has defied the combined
ideas of some of the greatest practical engineers of the world, for not
far from where the Angara leaves Lake Baikal it forms a big rapid over
two miles in length, and before gaining its subsequent level actually
falls over a ledge of rock which bars its entire width. It is this huge
“step” which must be removed before the river can be entirely used for
navigation. Engineers for years past have been studying the possibility
of removing this obstacle, but as yet nothing has been attempted.
Meanwhile, however, that Siberian magnate, M. Siberiakoff, has undertaken
the task of making the river navigable the whole way for steamers
running from Irkutsk to Lake Baikal, and he proposes carrying out his
scheme on a chain-hauling principle on the plans of the Swedish system.
Whether or not this will be successful on a Siberian river remains, of
course, to be seen.

The navigation of the river Selenga, Lake Baikal, and the river Angara
is at present only carried on by nine steamers, only three of which ply
between Irkutsk and the rapids. All these vessels, except one, are owned
by Russians. The one exception is owned and worked by an Englishman
resident in Irkutsk, Mr. Charles Lee, a gentleman to whom I have already
referred. The Russian steamers offer but little of interest, having been
purchased in Russia, and only put together in Siberia. Not so, however,
the English one, which was not only built and launched at Irkutsk, but
every portion of her construction, from her engines to her outer plates
and rivets, was made in Irkutsk under the supervision of Mr. Lee, who is
a practical engineer of great ability. This, as being, I believe, the
first attempt at actual shipbuilding (not merely putting together) in
Siberia, is of great interest, and more especially so when one learns
that the credit of the enterprise is due to an Englishman; not the least
interesting part of it being that this was Mr. Lee’s first experience in
shipbuilding, and that the whole of the work was done by convict labour;
also that the ship, when finished, was launched sideways, in itself a
somewhat novel feat.

We now followed the banks of the river the whole way; it widened more,
and when we at length sighted the lake, it must have been considerably
over a mile in width. Here, right in the centre of the seething rapids,
is the celebrated “Chaman” stone, a huge rock which from time immemorial
has withstood the tremendous rush of the waters round it. It is the
subject of many legends amongst the peasantry, one being that on the day
it is at length carried away, the waters of Lake Baikal will escape and
inundate the surrounding country. Without attaching any faith to such
legends, there are many people in Irkutsk who would regard with unfeigned
dread any tampering with the Angara rapids, and who believe that the
rocks which cause them alone hold the waters of mighty Lake Baikal in
check, and that the day they ceased to exist an awful disaster would
happen.

[Illustration: LIESTVINITZ, ON LAKE BAIKAL.]

I was prepared now for any surprises, after the transformation that had
so startled me in the early morning; so when a bend in the road brought
us in full view of this vast inland sea, I was not astonished to see
that it was still held in the icy grasp of the Siberian winter. The ice
commenced again at the very mouth of the Angara, a most extraordinary
phenomenon, for it was as though it had been cut away by man to allow of
the escape of the imprisoned waters. From one side of the stream to the
other the line of ice was as straight as if it had been ruled. The part
of the lake we had now reached is the narrowest end; the distance across
it here from shore to shore being about thirty miles, though the great
height of the mountains on the opposite side makes it look much narrower.
Our road now lay along the shore, a sort of rocky beach, reminding me
very much of bits of Devonshire I know well. Under the lofty cliffs ice
and snow became more plentiful, so my driver no longer had to search for
a likely sledging track, and for the next few miles, till we reached
the post station, we went along splendidly. The road in one place left
the shore for a short distance, and went right across a sort of little
harbour crowded with shipping; in fact, we actually had to dodge in and
out of the vessels, and duck our heads to avoid the ropes and spars.
My driver evidently knew the place well, for we went right through the
sort of fleet at full gallop, and a few minutes later reached the quaint
little village of Liestvinitz, the point at which the journey across
the lake is commenced. And after I had had a good sluice in a bucket of
cold water, I was soon comfortably settled at breakfast in one of the
cleanest post-houses I had yet seen. A real square meal, followed by a
good cigar, put me in the right sort of trim to fully appreciate the
novel experiences in store for me, and when I gave the order to start, I
was lounging back in my sledge literally basking in the genial sunshine,
prepared to enjoy my self to the very utmost. Try and imagine what it
would be like starting from the Lord Warden Hotel at Dover on a warm,
spring-like morning, with the intention of _driving_ over to Calais or
Boulogne, and you will have some idea of this part of my journey.

The opposite shore for which I was “bound” was quite invisible; and the
ice, owing to its smoothness and the unusual absence of snow on its
surface, almost presented the appearance of a very calm sea under the
bright blue morning sky.

[Illustration: A LAKE BAIKAL STEAMER.]

Lake Baikal, or, as it is called by Russians, “the Holy Sea of Siberia,”
is one of the largest fresh-water lakes in the world. Its elevation is
1500 feet above the level of the sea. This magnificent sheet of water
covers an area of 12,441 square miles, equal to sixty times that of the
Lake of Geneva, and is 420 miles in length, and forty in breadth in
the widest part. The principal characteristics of this big inland sea
are its great depth, the severe and sudden storms which rage upon it,
and the curious fact that seals are annually caught in it to a great
extent. That this immense lake owes its origin to volcanic agencies
has, I think, never been doubted; its enormous depth alone carries out
this supposition, for in parts, where lines of 5000 feet and 6000 feet
have been used, no bottom has been found, while in most places its
average depth is 5404 feet. I hear that it is said in Irkutsk that it
is only on Baikal that “a man learns first to pray from his heart,” for
so unexpectedly do its awful hurricanes arise, that no one can tell,
however promising may be the outlook when starting, under what conditions
the opposite shore will be reached. Of course I had no opportunity of
judging for myself, but I heard anything but good accounts of the three
steamers employed for the journey, which usually takes about six hours
under favourable circumstances. Other remarkable features of Lake Baikal
are the marvellous transparency of its water and the rapidity with which
it freezes when winter sets in. The appearance of the ice on the lake
depends entirely on the weather at the time the water congealed. If the
surface was then much agitated, the ice everywhere will present a broken
appearance like waves, plainly showing how sudden and irresistible was
the icy grasp of the Siberian winter. I am informed that along the coast
the curious phenomenon has often been noticed of _frozen waves_, the
curl of the water and even the foam being plainly distinguishable in the
solid mass. I was fortunate in finding the ice perfectly smooth; it had
evidently been a dead calm at the time the frost set in.

[Illustration: CROSSING LAKE BAIKAL.]

The road the whole way is indicated by means of a double row of pine
saplings stuck at intervals in the ice—a curious effect being thus
produced, not unlike an endless miniature boulevard stretching away
till it is lost in the distance. I could not help noticing the way the
horses are shod for the work: huge spikes are fastened to their shoes,
which, as they gallop along, splinter the ice in all directions, but give
them a firm foothold on its treacherous surface. In a very short time
after leaving picturesque Liestvenitz we were well out in the open,
and tearing along at the horses’ top speed, the motion being simply
delightful. For about a mile from the shore the ice had a thin layer of
snow over it, but we gradually left this sort of dazzling white carpet,
and at length reached the clear ice, when I saw around me the most
wonderful and bewitching sight I ever beheld. Owing to the marvellous
transparency of the water, the ice presented everywhere the appearance
of polished crystal, and, although undoubtedly of great thickness, was
so colourless that it was like passing over space. It gave me at first
quite an uncanny feeling to look over the side of the sledge down, into
the black abyss beneath; this feeling, however, gradually changed to one
of fascination, till at last I found it positively difficult to withdraw
my gaze from the awful depths, with nothing but this sheet of crystal
between me and eternity. I believe that most travellers, on crossing
the lake on the ice for the first time, experience the same weird and
fascinating influence. About half-way across I stopped to make a sketch
and take some photographs. It was no easy matter, as I found on getting
out of the sledge, for the ice was so slippery that in spite of my having
felt snow-boots on I could hardly stand. The death-like silence of the
surroundings reminded me not a little of my experiences in the ice of
the Kara Sea. This wonderful stillness was occasionally broken, however,
by curious sounds, as though big guns were being fired at some little
distance. They were caused by the cracking of the ice here and there.
I was told that in some parts of the lake were huge fissures, through
which the water could be seen. It is for this reason that it is always
advisable to do the journey by daylight.

We reached Moufshkaya, on the opposite coast, exactly four and a half
hours after leaving Liestvenitz, the horses having done the whole
distance of over thirty miles with only two stoppages of a few minutes
each. It was evidently an easy bit of work for them, as they seemed
as fresh when we drew up in the post-yard as when they started in the
morning.




CHAPTER XXI.

FROM IRKUTSK TO THE MONGOL CHINESE FRONTIER—_continued_.

    The road from Lake Baikal to Kiakhta—The “Kupetski
    track”—Incidents on the way—I change my sledge for a
    tarantass—Exciting adventures—Arrival at Troitzkosavsk, the
    business suburb of Kiakhta.


[Illustration: THE KUPETSKI TRACK.]

From Moufshkaya to Kiakhta I had the choice of two roads—one, the regular
Government post-road, which passes through Verchni Udinsk, and then
branches off to the frontier; the other, a private track made by the
merchant princes of Kiakhta, which goes straight there without touching
at any town, thus saving at least two days’ journey. This road, I had
been informed, could be used without any special permission, so, after
my recent experiences of Siberian posting, I did not hesitate which
of the two to go by, especially as I had been told that the “Kupetski
track,” or merchants’ route, was by far the more picturesque, while
Verchni Udinsk and the few scattered villages on the post-road offered
but the usual monotony of Siberian travel, which I knew only too well.
I was well repaid for my choice; for not only did the road pass through
some magnificent mountain and forest scenery, but the post-houses,
with only two exceptions, were better than I had usually found on the
Government roads.

For many miles after leaving the lake the road passed through a narrow
gorge with high mountains and dense pine forest on either side. Night
was coming on, and in the deepening gloom around me, whence issued the
sound of a rushing torrent, the effect was very weird. Here the snow
lay thick, so there was no doubt about the practicability of sledging,
and we got along very well; but we did not reach the next post-house
till it was quite dark. After but a very short delay, just to get fresh
horses, I started again. The night was so black that had it not been for
the snow on the road it would have been a most difficult matter to find
it at all; as it was, we shortly after had a slight accident. In one
part of the road, where it was exceptionally narrow, one of the horses
somehow got out of the track and fell into a deep hole full of snow. The
other two sagacious animals fortunately had the instinct to stop, or we
might have had an awkward time had they started kicking. The yemschik
was evidently used to these little _contretemps_, for the incident did
not seem to put him out very much, and we soon got the half-buried brute
on _terra firma_ again. It occurred to me that all such incidents might
not end equally well, so I decided to wait in the next post-house till
daybreak, as the road seemed to get darker and darker, and more and more
uneven. On reaching the station, however, one look was sufficient; it was
so infested with cockroaches and other vermin that rather than spend the
night in it I determined to push on at all hazards. So uninhabitable, in
fact, was the place that I positively could not remain in it even while
the horses were being got ready.

[Illustration: A POST-HOUSE ON THE KUPETSKI TRACK.]

After leaving this station the road appeared to get more sandy and
with less snow on it; so, in order to make it easier for his horses,
the yemschik followed a narrow track leading right through the forest.
I soon fell asleep, and was in the midst of a delightful dream when I
was awakened by the man calling to me to get up. At first I thought we
had reached the next station, but on looking round I saw we were in a
sort of clearing in the very depths of the forest. It was snowing so
thickly at the time that one could scarcely make out anything a few
yards distant. On either side of the sledge were two trees so close to
it that I immediately suspected what was wrong, so without hesitation I
jumped out, and the yemschik explained to me that he had lost his way,
and had somehow got the sledge wedged between these two trees. Here was
a predicament! For the next hour we were trying all we knew to get the
clumsy vehicle free, and it was only after endless futile efforts that
we literally had to cut it out—with no little difficulty, for the wood
seemed as hard as iron. By the time we got under way again, and after
searching for the track, day was beginning to break, and it was broad
daylight when we reached the station. It had taken over five hours
to do the last fifteen miles. The postmaster here, who spoke German
fluently, informed me that it was out of the question attempting to
proceed any further in a sledge, and that I should have now to continue
my journey in a _tarantass_, or post-cart. As he agreed to purchase my
sledge for exactly what I had given for it, I could not object, though I
felt that the remainder of the route to Kiakhta would not be enjoyable,
as I should, at every station, have to repack my baggage in a fresh
conveyance. However, there was no help for it. A Tarantass is a most
curious and distinctively Russian vehicle. In shape it is not unlike a
very unwieldy barouche, with a large fixed hood at the back. As in a
sledge, the luggage is packed inside so as to form a seat, and, though
not an elegant-looking conveyance, it is well adapted to the rough roads
of the country. I was once more travelling on wheels, for the first time
since I had left England.

The country now began to assume a much more barren and steppe-like
appearance, and there was hardly a trace of snow anywhere. The trees
also seemed to have disappeared, and for miles ahead there was a bare
undulating plain. I could not help noticing that everything was now
beginning to look more Chinese, or, rather, Mongolian. Even the tea
caravans we passed were composed of quaint-looking carts, undoubtedly of
Chinese origin, whilst the drivers, with their swarthy sunburnt faces,
looked strangely out of keeping with the cold landscape.

[Illustration: A TEA CART.]

In the afternoon we reached a small river, over which, as usual, the road
passed on the ice. My yemschik, quite a young lad, was, however, in no
hurry to cross when we saw a cart which was coming towards us suddenly
half disappear through the ice, which was evidently very rotten. The
water, fortunately, was only four feet deep at the utmost, so beyond the
difficulty of getting his horse and cart out again he ran no risk. After
watching the fellow (who was standing up to his waist in the icy-cold
water) in his vain efforts to move the lumbersome vehicle, I decided that
we could not stay where we were all day, and that we had to get across
somehow, so I persuaded my youthful Jehu to try a narrower spot a little
further down, in the hopes of the ice being stronger there. Well, we went
at it full tilt, hoping to get across with a rush; and so we did till
within about twenty yards of the opposite bank, when, with a sickening
crash, the ice gave way, and we were in the water. The horses immediately
began kicking and plunging to such an extent that I expected every moment
the heavy tarantass would turn over and all my baggage be lost. For a few
minutes my driver absolutely lost his head; but, finding that the horses
in their mad endeavours to get out had so loosened the ice as to clear
the way, he cooled down, and we managed to reach the bank without any
further mishap than getting slightly wet. As we drove full gallop along
the road to make up for lost time, I looked back and saw the peasant with
his horse and cart still in the water, and taking it very quietly. A
basin of hot Bouillon Fleet at the next station soon set me right, and I
felt no ill effects from the cold water.

I was now rapidly nearing my destination, when on reaching the last
station but one, as evening was coming on, the postmaster said something
which I did not quite understand, that he did not like to let me go on,
about its being soon dark and the road a bad one, also something which
I did not catch. However, I had made up my mind to reach Kiakhta that
night if it could be done, so I peremptorily ordered the fresh tarantass
and horses at once, and after but a short delay I was soon on the move
again. The road now lay right across the turf, and, owing to the nature
of the soil, was scarcely visible in the rapidly failing light; in fact,
in many places I wondered how the driver found his way at all, for I
could see no sign of any track.

It was quite dark when we came to what looked like an immense white
plain. This, the yemschik told me, was the river Selenga. This majestic
river, which flows into Lake Baikal, was here as wide as the Thames at
Gravesend, and in the darkness the opposite bank was scarcely visible.
Our road lay right across its ice-bound surface. At the edge of the ice
my driver drew up, and, getting down, said he would go and look round
before venturing on it, as a man who had that afternoon came in from
the next station reported that the ice was beginning to break up. I
immediately remembered the incident which had happened only a few miles
back, and visions rose up before me of what would be the result in the
event of such an accident occurring on this mighty river, so I felt just
the least little bit uncomfortable when, after being absent some twenty
minutes, he came back and said he thought it would be all right, so on we
went. It may have been my fancy, but the heavy lumbering vehicle seemed
to weigh more than ever now, as it rattled over the ice of the river.
We had reached, I suppose, about the middle, when suddenly the horses
drew up of their own accord, snorting with fear. A large dark mass was
in front of them. Nothing could induce them to go on, so the driver got
down to see what it was, and almost immediately returned and, getting up,
hastily drove in another direction, informing me, in an awed whisper,
that it was water. I then made out that the dark mass was a huge gap in
the ice. The instinct of the horses had undoubtedly saved us!

[Illustration: DAY-DREAMS: A SKETCH IN THE TRANS-BAIKAL.

(_The curious hanging arrangement is a cradle._)]

After a considerable _détour_ we reached what appeared to be the opposite
bank, only to find that it was an island, and that there was another
broad piece of ice still to be crossed. The driver had now the greatest
difficulty in getting the terror-stricken animals to go on at all. It
was only after a lot of coaxing, and eventually leading them himself,
that they could be persuaded to venture on the treacherous surface. This
time, however, we got across without further incident, and it was with
a genuine feeling of relief that I felt the tarantass once more rolling
over the grass.

After a short search the track was again found, and an hour later I
reached the last post-house before Kiakhta, after a most exciting
“stage.” There is, of course, no other means of crossing Siberian rivers
during the winter but on the ice. Towards the end of the winter, just
before the _debâcle_ begins, it is always advisable, where possible, to
cross the big rivers by daylight, on account of the many fissures in the
ice. I remember nothing of the next twenty versts, for I went off into a
deep sleep, probably occasioned by the recent excitement, and never moved
till I was woke up by the yemschik calling out to me that we had reached
our destination, and wanting to know where he should drive me.

I sat up and looked round me; no easy matter, for it was snowing so
thickly that I could scarcely see anything, and the dreary-looking
deserted street looked still more wretched as, in the piercing wind,
the blinding flakes were whirled about in clouds. It was as uninviting
and wintry a scene as could be well imagined, and for a moment I wished
myself back in my comfortable quarters at Irkutsk.

So this was the frontier city of Kiakhta, the delightful place where,
as I had read, it never snows, and where, pinning my faith on this
outrageous statement, I had been fondly imagining I should find a
genial temperature; but the Siberian winter evidently holds good to its
reputation to the furthermost confines of the vast country. However, it
was no time for this fanciful musing, for we were in the middle of the
night, and the road also, and I knew not where to turn for a lodging.
The only hotel of Kiakhta was not strongly recommended (which means a
great deal in Siberia), so I had made up my mind to seek accommodation
elsewhere; but the whole town was asleep. The yemschik then said he knew
of some people who had a room to let, if we could manage to wake them
up. So we went to the house, and, happily, were successful. The room, on
inspection, proved not only comfortable and clean, but wonderfully cheap
in the bargain. So I decided to remain there during my stay in the town.
And how thankful I was when I at length “turned in” for a good night’s
rest after my somewhat eventful and fatiguing journey!

[Illustration: THE HIGH STREET, TROITZKOSAVSK.

[_To face p. 245._]

My lodgings were in the High Street of Troitzkosavsk, the business suburb
of Kiakhta, for in the frontier city itself there are not above fifty
houses, nearly all of which belong to the great merchants. The frontier
commissioner also lives there. I suppose it was the recollection of all
the gaieties at Irkutsk, for I found Kiakhta and Troitzkosavsk terribly
dull after the capital—so much so, in fact, that had I not made up my
mind to complete my work I should have pushed on towards Ourga without
delay, more especially as the weather continued bitterly cold and it
snowed almost every day. There was only one redeeming feature in this
dead-alive little frontier city, and that was the novel sights one
occasionally sees in the streets. After the unvaried monotony of costume
in other Siberian towns, it was refreshing here to see wild-looking
Mongolians dashing up the quiet street on their wiry little ponies; or
an occasional camel-caravan, with tea, arriving from the desert. It was
a sign that a warmer and more picturesque country was close at hand,
and made me long the more to get out of cold Siberia. But the novel and
interesting sights at Kiakhta were but poor specimens of what I hoped to
see further on; so I decided not to begin sketching them till I saw the
genuine article in Mongolia itself.

[Illustration: MY FIRST GLIMPSE OF MONGOLIA.

[_To face p. 246._]

By the way, a somewhat interesting incident occurred whilst I was here.
I had made friends with a local photographer, a man of some considerable
talent, and would frequently while away an hour in his company. One day
that I was visiting his studio for the first time, I was much struck with
a “background” painted on a large canvas lying against the wall. It was
so exceptionally good that I could not refrain from making a remark upon
it, when I was informed, to my astonishment, that it was the work of his
assistant, who was standing by. One does not expect to meet artists of
talent in local photographers’ employ in these far-away places, and I
could not help saying so. I was still further impressed when the young
fellow, in reply to my question as to whether he had any other work to
show, produced a portfolio of sketches which indicated a talent rarely
met with. Becoming enthusiastic, I told him he must be mad to be wasting
his time at photography in this out-of-the-way town when St. Petersburg
would be acclaiming him as a born artist. After a deal of beating about
the bush, and evident reluctance on his part, I learnt the true facts
of the case, that he and his employer (both eminent artists, as I was
afterwards informed), were political exiles, suffering a long term of
banishment. Many of the sketches shown to me (one of which I give in
facsimile) related to prisoners’ life, and were evidently done during the
long march across Siberia. I could not help being strongly impressed with
the idea that a system which would allow a prisoner to beguile the tedium
of the march by following his artistic proclivities cannot, however
faulty its theory may be, in practice be so cruelly _disciplinaire_ as
many would have us believe.

[Illustration: A BOURRIATE LADY.]

Meanwhile, my work progressed rapidly, and after a little over a
fortnight’s stay, I saw my way clear to arrange for my further journey to
the sacred city of Ourga, and then across the Gobi desert to China; but
of all this I will tell you in my next chapter.

CHAPTER XXII.

ACROSS MONGOLIA.

    to-day—Curious customs—Hair-dressing extraordinary—A pestilent
    farmyard—Exciting incidents—A forced encampment—An awful
    night’s experiences—The Manhati Pass—Magnificent scenery—I

    Mongolia—Arrival at Ourga.


[Illustration: ON THE ROAD TO OURGA.]

There are two means of getting from Kiakhta, the Siberian frontier
town, to the Mongolian capital, Ourga—either by camel caravan or in
an ordinary Russian tarantass, drawn by horses. I chose the latter
conveyance. The distance, a little over two hundred miles, takes four
days, as the same horses have to do the entire journey, there being no
means of getting fresh relays on the road.

It was a lovely, spring-like morning when, in a fairly comfortable
vehicle with three strong horses, I crossed the frontier, my saddle-horse
being fastened loosely alongside the tarantass, to be ready at a moment’s
notice in case of need when fording rivers or for sporting purposes.

What actually marks the “frontier” it would be difficult to say. Beyond
a narrow, dirty strip of what I believe is called “neutral ground,” but
which is evidently used principally as a sort of Russo-Chinese dust-bin,
there is nothing to denote the borders of the two vast empires, and
the road passes right across into Mongolia without a break. Many years
ago, I learnt, some sort of barrier existed, but it has long since been
done away with. The Russians, who, as a rule, are so fond of sticking
up their national coat of arms and placing their black-and-white
sentry-boxes wherever practicable, doubtless consider this remote corner
unworthy of such ostentation, for there is here a striking absence of
these (in Siberia) familiar objects. Mentioning this noteworthy absence
of any national insignia here, reminds me of a remarkable instance of
clairvoyance on the part of a traveller who crossed this frontier
_within the last five years_, and who described, in his subsequent
“Impressions de Voyage,” in a most graphic manner, having passed, on
that auspicious occasion, “a guard-house and high wooden gates,” which
were burnt down _nineteen years_ previously! Once, however, on the other
side of the neutral ground, one finds one’s self in quite another world,
so to speak, for here is the wonderfully quaint little Chinese town
of Maimachin, which presents as great a contrast to the neighbouring
Siberian town, Kiakhta, as could be imagined.

From the outside, little can be seen of Maimachin, as it is surrounded
by a high wooden palisade; but once entered through the picturesque
archway, Siberia is, as it were, left so completely that it takes a few
minutes to get used to the wonderful transformation, for at one step, so
to speak, one finds one’s self in the Far East, with all its brilliant
colouring and strange costumes. There are probably no two nations in
the world which present a greater dissimilarity in point of artistic
taste than the Russian and the Chinese; so, going direct from one to
the other, the contrast is positively startling. Maimachin is a poor
specimen of a Chinese town, but is almost like a museum compared with
the monotonous aspect of Siberian cities. This town, with about two
thousand inhabitants, is of some importance as the final stage for the
camel caravans with tea before they reach Siberia and the consignment
is handed over to the Russian merchants. It therefore always presents
a busy and animated appearance. A most striking peculiarity here is the
entire absence of women; for, according to Chinese law, no female of that
nation is permitted to dwell beyond the Great Wall. The Chinese who seek
their fortunes in Mongolia readily, however, console themselves with
Mongolian ladies, in the absence of their own countrywomen.

After passing through Maimachin, the road—a broad, well-defined track—lay
for many miles across level grassy plains, bounded in the extreme
distance by a low range of hills, and was flat and uninteresting in the
extreme. A few wretched _yourts_, or huts, with some camels and cattle
browsing here and there, were the only signs of life in the vast solitude.

[Illustration: A MONGOL YOURT.]

Before proceeding further into Mongolia, a short description of the
Mongols and their habitations may be of interest. A yourt is a sort
of cone-shaped hut, covered with a kind of coarse felt made out of
sheep’s wool. Its walls are held up on the inside, to a height of about
five feet, by a circular arrangement of wooden lattice-work; this also
supports the roof, not unlike a huge umbrella, the ribs fitting tightly
into the lower part; the centre of this is something like a big wheel,
from which the ribs radiate, being left open to allow the smoke from the
fireplace to escape. This fireplace in the centre of the apartment is
usually a rough sort of iron basket on feet. One portion of the interior
is invariably furnished with a kind of altar, on which are placed various
religious emblems; for the Mongols are a sincerely devout people, and
their devotions form an important item in their daily routine. The
residence of a noble or rich Mongol is usually composed of several
yourts for the different members of the family, and is often gorgeously
furnished, one or two I have visited having valuable carpets and curios
in them which simply made my mouth water. In such dwellings of rich
Mongols one yourt is specially set apart for the reception of visitors;
but these abodes of wealth are very few and far between, possibly because
there are not many rich Mongols. By “rich,” I mean being the possessor
of many horses or camels and head of cattle and much _yamba_, as Chinese
bar silver is called, for gold is not valued at all by the Mongols. The
average yourts were indescribably filthy, not only serving as shelter
for families of several persons of both sexes herded indiscriminately
together, but in many cases for sheep or goats with their young. As,
added to which, the smoke from the fire as a rule only partially escapes,
the atmosphere under such conditions may be imagined. Living, therefore,
in such human pigsties, it is not to be wondered that the ordinary
Mongol presents an extremely unsavoury appearance, so that it is often
difficult to tell whether nature gave him a black or a white skin; for
they are not a water-loving race, cleanliness evidently not being one of
the appurtenances of godliness from Mongol-Buddhist point of view.

[Illustration: A MONGOL.]

The curious fashion of the women fixing their hair in a sort of circle
round their faces by means of massive silver ornaments has often a very
incongruous effect, as I have seen old hags, dressed in a mass of rags
which a professional London rag-picker would pass in disgust, with quite
a little fortune on their heads, in many cases even among the poorer
classes to the value of £30 or £40! All the family savings go first
towards providing a wife with the orthodox jewellery, as a girl is not
spoken of as a “woman” till her hair is dressed properly—never mind the
rest of her wardrobe. Among the very poorest classes I have occasionally
seen strips of wood used when silver could not be afforded, but this is
very exceptional. Of course, in their dress, as in their dwellings, there
are social class differences, and the rich or noble Mongols wear clothes
of the finest silks of the most gorgeous hues, their wives and daughters
being decorated with costly silver jewellery of exquisite workmanship.
Among women of the higher classes are to be found actual beauties, and
the curious method of arranging the hair is really very becoming when
it encircles a pretty face with sparkling eyes and pearly teeth. I
remember on one occasion seeing a princess riding through Ourga who was
so startlingly beautiful that the apparition simply took my breath away;
it was like a vision from the “Arabian Nights,” and for several days
after I felt quite “smitten” with the lovely unknown one, and my appetite
suffered considerably in consequence!

Although as a distinct nation the Mongols are slowly disappearing,
owing to gradual fusion with the Chinese, still there are many amongst
the descendants of the old princes who yet cling to the idea that the
glorious times of Genghis Khan will again return, and that some day
another such leader will appear and restore to this once so mighty race
its old prestige. In fact, there is one sect amongst the people who
believes that Genghis Khan is not dead at all, but has only disappeared
for a time, and will on some not very distant date again return to earth;
and in the national songs the name of this hero and his great deeds are
continually appearing. _En attendant_ this millennium, however, the
Mongols have lost all trace of the formidable warriors they were in
the past, and have lapsed into such quiet and inoffensive beings that
it is hard to realize they are descendants of the mighty horde which
once conquered Russia, and threw all Europe into a state of panic.
Of their old national characteristics but one really remains—their
wonderful horsemanship; for I believe that the Mongols as a nation enjoy
the undisputed reputation of being the finest horsemen in the world,
and this in spite of their, to European ideas, somewhat ungainly seat
in consequence of the use of a short stirrup. One can imagine what
magnificent cavalry these men must have made under their old leaders.
However, _revenons a nos moutons_.

As we gradually neared the confines of this “steppe,” trees appeared
on either side, till we were in a sort of open forest when we reached
the foot of the hills. Out on the plains, in the brilliant sunshine,
there had not been the slightest trace on the ground of the recent heavy
falls of snow; but among the trees and on the higher ground it still lay
thickly, and gave a very cold and wintry appearance to the scene. The
extreme mildness of the temperature was, however, rapidly doing its work,
and under the genial rays of the sun the remaining vestiges of winter
fast disappearing. The road, in consequence, was in an awful state,
in many places the water and mud being so deep as to render it almost
impassable. Our three game little horses, however, struggled bravely on,
and, without any further excitement than the waving of the driver’s puny
whip, managed to get us along.

With the exception of a couple of hours’ rest in the middle of the day,
we pushed on steadily till nightfall, when we reached the station
where the halt for the night was to be made—a couple of yourts close
together forming a sort of Mongol farm, where my driver from experience
knew he was certain to be able to get hay and water for the horses. I
do not think I was ever in a more gloomy or depressing spot. It was a
sort of narrow valley between two high hills, with scarcely a trace of
vegetation. Heavy clouds, gradually coming up, now quite obscured the
sky, and the deadly stillness of the air betokened some approaching
change in the weather during the night. All around were curious looking
objects lying on the ground. In the twilight I could not at first
distinguish what they were, but on a nearer inspection I discovered
that these were dead oxen. I counted fourteen lying within a few yards
of the huts; and, judging from the odour, I imagine they must have been
dead some considerable time. On inquiring of my driver the reason of
so wholesale a slaughter, he told me that they had not been killed,
but had died from starvation, owing to the severe winter. The wretched
inhabitants of the two yourts, in the apathy caused by their misfortunes,
had not the energy to remove the decomposing carcases out of sight. I
could not help feeling thankful that we had encamped far enough away to
be clear of the perfume of this pestilent farmyard.

The night I passed comfortably enough wrapped up in my _dacha_ in the
tarantass, whilst my driver, used to the peculiarities of Mongol life,
sought his couch inside one of the yourts. Towards morning it came on to
blow and rain, and in a short time such a tornado burst over us, that I
expected every minute the ramshackle vehicle would be blown bodily over;
fortunately, however, it was heavy enough to withstand the gale, which
abated almost as suddenly as it had arisen, and when towards five o’clock
we made a start, it was a beautifully clear morning, with every promise
of a fine day. The country presented now, if anything, a more desolate
appearance than any we had hitherto passed through—it was a “desert” in
every respect. All around were low sandy hills, without even a bush to
break their monotonous appearance; not even a blade of grass was to be
seen on the wide expanse of stone and sand. The aspect was uninteresting
in the extreme, so I got my driver to “hurry up a bit,” so as to get
out of the dreary surroundings as quickly as possible. We had to do the
next eight hours with scarcely any stoppage, as there was no sign of any
human habitation anywhere in this solitude, and no human beings meant no
water or hay for the horses, so we were obliged to push on at any cost.
About one o’clock we at length sighted a few wretched yourts, and in a
few minutes drew up at the station, after the longest stage we had yet
made. The horses did not seem very fatigued, however; as long as they got
plenty to eat and drink, the distances between the stations affected
them but little—the hard work they were used to. Four hours we had to
pass in this dreary uninteresting place. I managed somehow to while away
the time with my pipe and sketch-book, and very glad was I when we at
last started preparations for continuing the journey.

[Illustration: OUR MIDDAY HALT.]

The day, which had commenced so brightly, had not fulfilled its early
promise; the sky had gradually become obscured, and, as on the previous
afternoon, the wind also showed signs of renewed activity; so when the
yemschik told me that we had forty versts (twenty-eight miles) to do
before we reached the next station, and that on the way a nasty bit of
river had to be crossed, I was still more anxious to push on, so as to
reach our encampment before dark if possible. For several miles the road
now lay along a level plain, intersected here and there by small brooks,
swelled into rushing torrents owing to the recent rains, and which in
many cases were only with great difficulty crossed, as the banks were
generally very steep. Owing to the many delays and the frequent big
_détours_ we had to make, night was upon us when we at last reached the
river the yemschik had told me of in the afternoon. By this time the
wind, which fortunately was at our backs, had changed to a piercing cold
gale from the north, and snow was beginning to fall heavily. There was
every prospect of an extremely dirty night, and one which I should not
have cared to be out in anywhere under any circumstances, still less in a
rickety tarantass on the desolate steppes of Mongolia. In the darkness I
could hear the rushing sound of the swollen river as it raced by, and I
could just manage to discern its turbid stream by the large masses of ice
floating by like ghosts in the gloom.

It was anything but an encouraging spectacle, and had there been the
slightest sign of anything to afford a kind of shelter, I should have
persuaded the driver to wait until daybreak before crossing; but all
around was bleak, open plain, over which the merciless wind blew with
ever increasing force, and the driving snow felt like so many needles,
so there was absolutely nothing for it but to chance getting across
the river, as the man said the station was only some ten versts off.
The horses, however, evidently took a different view of the matter,
and it was some time before they could be got to advance even to the
water’s edge, and still longer before they would venture into it. It
was an awkward moment, for they started plunging and kicking to such an
extent, that I expected every moment to find myself in the water with
the tarantass on the top of me. We had nearly got over, and without any
incident, for the water was barely four feet deep, when my saddle horse
was seized with ungovernable fear, and managed to break loose somehow,
and bolted back as fast as he could. A few minutes after and we were safe
on the opposite bank.

In the mean time the snow was coming down so thickly that everything was
already completely covered with it, so much so that it was impossible to
distinguish the track leading from the river. In vain did the yemschik
get down and search about on his hands and knees for some clue to guide
him as to its whereabouts. His efforts were futile, for there was
absolutely nothing to go by; and although after a few minutes’ search he
got up and drove off full speed, I felt convinced by his manner that he
was on a wild-goose chase. And so it proved, for in a very short time
he pulled up again and once more got down to have another search. But it
was useless, as I could see by the bewildered way in which he was looking
about, and every minute made the chances of hitting on the track still
more remote, for all this time it was snowing so thickly that it was
almost impossible to see a yard ahead. The cold was also intense.

On the man getting back on to his seat, as I thought with the intention
of driving on further, I asked him what he intended doing, as I felt
sure it was useless risk going on blindly, and perchance getting turned
over into some gully or losing ourselves quite hopelessly. At first
he did not reply, and when he did it was only to mumble out something
about hearing dogs barking close by, so there must be a yourt near. I
listened, but heard absolutely nothing but the roaring and screeching of
the wind; when, on looking at the fellow again, I saw to my horror that
_he was going to sleep_—the long exposure to the cold was beginning to
take effect. Sleep under such conditions I was well aware meant _death_,
so I immediately sprang up and commenced shaking him as hard as I could,
and after a while succeeded in waking him. I then told him that I had
decided not to risk going on any further, but to remain where we were
till morning, and that we should have to unharness the horses and make
them as comfortable as we could with some oats, which we providentially
happened to have left. Suiting my action to my words, I got out and lent
him a hand as well as I could, although it was more to show him that I
intended to stand no nonsense than to really help; for Siberian harness
is a complicated arrangement of tied ropes and straps, which wants some
knowing before meddling with it in the dark. My determination had the
desired effect, for in a very few minutes we had the horses stalled on
either side of the shafts, which we managed to prop up, and by placing a
piece of loose sacking over them, made a very good impromptu manger, out
of which the three hardy brutes were soon eating their oats as tranquilly
as though in a stable, paying not the slightest heed to the snow or wind,
so used are they to be out in all weathers.

All being secure, I then ordered the man to get into the tarantass and
roll himself up in his sheepskin, and after a stiff glass of vodka
apiece, to keep out as much cold as possible, I attempted to go to sleep.
I say attempted, for very little sleep did I get, and I hope never again
in my life to spend such a wretched night as I did that 8th of April.
The cold seemed to come in at every corner and crevice of the hood which
sheltered us, and it was almost impossible to get even the chill off one,
whilst the whistling of the wind around and the uneasy movements of the
horses combined to keep me from anything but just dozing off till the
welcome dawn appeared; and with it the weather cleared up and the storm
abated. Then what a magnificent spectacle presented itself to my eyes on
looking out of the tarantass! in spite of being cramped in every joint
with the cold, I could not help being impressed with the grandeur of the
effect. We were right at the very foot of the mountains, which, covered
with snow, towered high up above us, like dim white monoliths against the
deep blue sky, their summits, which caught the rays of the rising sun,
glowing like solid gold.

The yemschik, who had got up some little time before me, had been
meanwhile reconnoitring for the lost track, and eventually found it only
a short distance away, but quite in another direction to the one we had
been proceeding in; so it was fortunate we had not gone on, as he himself
owned. The horses, though naturally not looking over-bright, appeared
none the worse for their exposure to the storm, so, before proceeding to
the station, the man suggested his galloping back on one of them a short
distance, to look if he could see anything of our runaway. This I agreed
to; so off he went, and, as luck had it, returned in less than an hour
with the delinquent in tow. He had found it on the bank of the river,
close by where it had bolted. We were not long in reaching the station
after this, and, in spite of its grimy interior, I managed to make myself
really comfortable in front of its cheerful fire till it was time to
start again.

We had now reached the _crux_ of the journey to Ourga, the pass through
the Manhati Mountains. I gathered, from what the Mongol of the yourt was
telling my yemschik, that the road further on was in a very dangerous
condition, and that therefore he would go with us part of the way, to
lend a hand in case of accident. We therefore made a start, under the
pilotage of our good-natured host, and he and I rode on a little distance
ahead to ascertain the condition of the track after the storm. The sharp,
exhilarating morning air and the bright sunshine considerably helped
to liven me up again, and even my wiry little horse, with a good feed
inside him, was as game as possible, and evidently not a bit the worse
for his night’s outing. It had undoubtedly been a very severe frost
during, or immediately after, the storm, for the steep track was simply
coated with ice; so we had to proceed very cautiously indeed, and pick
our way along as well as we could between the rocks, the heavy tarantass
following us up very slowly. In many places the road followed the very
edge of a precipice, where any accident would probably have been followed
by disastrous consequences. It took us two hours to reach the top of
the defile, and then, after a few minutes to rest the horses, during
which time I had opportunity to fully enjoy as fine a panorama of forest
and mountain as I have ever seen, we started on the downward journey,
which, if anything, offered still more difficulties than the part
just accomplished; for this side of the mountain facing the south, had
evidently been but the previous day a sort of series of torrents caused
by the melting snow, and the severe frost during the night had been
sufficient to coat them thickly with ice, but naturally not strong enough
to bear the weight of a man, still less a horse, so my poor yemschik was
more than half the time floundering about up to his knees in icy cold
water, as he had to lead the horses the whole way, so treacherous was
the ground, and timid the animals in consequence. In spite, however, of
the almost impassable state of the defile, we managed fortunately to get
through without the slightest incident worth mentioning, and exactly four
hours after starting reached the plains once more, where the whole aspect
of the surroundings changed suddenly as it were.

In front of me, stretching away into the far distance on either side,
till where it was bounded by a faint blue wall of mountains, was a vast
prairie, and on its surface not a trace of snow was to be seen. In the
long grass cattle were grazing peacefully, or standing knee-deep in
a rippling stream, which sparkled like a silver ribbon thrown across
the green sward. Some little distance off, a group of Mongols, dressed
in yellow and red _khalats_, were galloping merrily along, the sound
of their voices and laughter reaching me quite plainly on the still
atmosphere; while a gorgeously coloured tent near by gave a still
further note of colour to this delightful picture. In the warm sunshine
the effect was almost one of having reached a “promised land,” so great
a contrast did it offer to the cold wintry appearance on the mountains
close by.

The rest of the journey was all clear sailing; for, with the exception of
the last part of the road, which was again very mountainous, the track
was very level, and we made good progress, encamping for the usual halts
at the yourts of friendly Mongols, known to my driver. By the way, an
incident occurred on one of these occasions, which may be of interest.
At a yourt where we had halted for our midday rest, a large tea caravan,
consisting of several hundred carts, was also encamped; all the oxen
were out on the plains, and the drivers, a crowd of some twenty swarthy
Bourriats and Mongols, were loafing about, smoking and whiling away the
time as best they could. My arrival was, of course, quite an event, and,
although my man asked them not to do so, they crowded round me in a very
offensive manner as soon as I left the tarantass. One may imagine what
would be the effect if a Mongol were suddenly to arrive in the midst
of a crowd of English roughs. My position was somewhat similar, except
that there was no friendly policeman near. I felt instinctively that
I was going to have a very unpleasant time of it unless I managed to
score off them somehow; nor was I mistaken, for in a few minutes a sort
of Mongol-Bourriat chaff commenced at my expense, although, of course,
I understood but very little of what was said. Well, this went on for
a little while, during which I was positively hemmed in by the crowd,
who would persist in feeling my clothes and otherwise making me very
uncomfortable. My usually small stock of patience was getting exhausted,
and I felt my “back getting up.” At last I could stand it no longer. The
leader of the gang, who had been doing his best to distinguish himself
in his attempts at “chaff,” having asked me several questions in Russian
which I did not understand, I told him curtly that I did not understand
him, as I spoke but very little Russian.

“Ah,” said the fellow, imitating my accent, “you don’t speak Russian,
don’t you?” and there was a general roar of laughter at his imitative
powers, at the same time one of the crowd was violently pushed, or rather
thrown, against me from behind.

This was sufficient. My blood was up, so, swinging round my elbows to
clear myself some room, I deliberately turned up my cuffs and, going
up to the leader, shook my fist close under his nose, at the same time
telling him as well as I could that although _I_ could not speak Russian
_that_ could any language, as I would soon show him if he wanted to try.
My determination had a magical effect, for he retreated a few paces, and,
smiling in a sheepish sort of way, replied that he did not understand
the _Angliski Boxe_, and added something in an undertone to the men near
him, at which they all gradually moved off and left me master of the
situation. I was not interfered with again after that. I had pulled off a
successful “bluff”!

On nearing Ourga snow once more began to show itself thickly on the
ground, and the temperature gradually lowered till it was so chilly
even in the sunshine that I had to keep my furs on. We were now in
sight of the last spur of mountains which separated us from the plain
in which Ourga is situated, and had a very steep bit of track to do
for the next hour or so. At last we reached the top, where was a huge
cairn, consisting of bones, stones, and all sorts of rags and odds and
ends, offerings to Buddha by pious Mongols on reaching the end of their
journey, or the top of the mountain. As it was now all downhill work till
we reached our destination, I lit my pipe and composed myself comfortably
for the remaining hour before me. But my comfort was destined to be but
of short duration, for the track down the mountain-side, in fact the
whole way, was simply awful, and the shaking and bumping I got during
that hour makes me feel sore even now to think of. The heavy springless
tarantass having to go over rocks and gullies which would have smashed
up any ordinary conveyance in a few minutes, I got the man to drive
slowly in the hope of lessening the shocks as much as possible, for I
was doubtful whether my inside could hold out long under such treatment;
but slow or fast seemed to make but little difference, so at last in
despair I ordered the man to get over the ground as rapidly as possible,
in the hopes of getting to my destination with, at any rate, some of my
most vital arrangements unimpaired. At length a welcome turn in the road
showed me that my sufferings were nearly ended, for on the plain below I
saw a huge conglomeration of dirty yourts and wooden palisades, with here
and there a somewhat higher building to break the dull level monotony.
This dreary place, looking doubly wretched in the wintry surroundings,
was the capital of Mongolia, the sacred city of Ourga, of which I had
heard so much and travelled so far to see. It was a disappointing sight,
to say the least of it, and, with the recollection of my long and
comfortless journey still fresh in my memory, the first thought that
crossed my mind was, _le jeu ne vaut pas la chandelle_.




CHAPTER XXIII.

THE SACRED CITY OF OURGA.

    The Russian consul, M. Feodroff—Hospitality of the
    Consulate—The “lions” of Ourga—The colossal statue
    of the “Maidha”—The “Bogdor of Kurene”—An impromptu
    interview—Prayer-wheels—Praying boards—Religious fervour
    of the Mongols.


[Illustration: A STREET MUSICIAN, OURGA.]

Disappointing though the first view of the sacred city undoubtedly
is, when seen from the mountains, it certainly improves on a nearer
inspection. As I drove through the broad principal thoroughfare, which
was thronged with as noisy and picturesque a crowd as could well be
imagined, I could not help coming to the conclusion that, however
uninteresting its buildings were, among its inhabitants, at any rate,
I should find ample scope for my brush and pencil during my stay. On
reaching the house of the merchant on whom I had a letter of credit,
and where I had anticipated being able to find a lodging, I learned, to
my disappointment, that there was no room to spare for the moment, but
that the Russian consul had sent word (as evidently my arrival had been
expected) that I was to stay at the Consulate; so, without losing time,
I ordered my man to drive there at once, as it was getting dark and the
horses had evidently had enough work for the day. It took half an hour to
reach the large block of buildings, with the gilt dome, which represents
the kingdom of the Czar at Ourga.

[Illustration: THE PRINCIPAL THOROUGHFARE, OURGA.

[_To face p. 273._]

For reasons best known to the authorities, the Consulate is situated
at least two miles from the city, and stands quite alone, out in the
desert, some distance from any habitation. Most of the few travellers, I
believe, who have visited this out-of-the-way corner of the world have
been received and entertained under its hospitable roof during the few
days their stay has usually lasted, for accommodation in Ourga itself
is very difficult to find, owing to the few Europeans living there.
Putting up at a Mongol yourt being, of course, out of the question, and
as I had come with the express intention of studying this city and its
inhabitants, so little known, I presently decided that I should have
but little opportunity of so doing if I fixed my quarters so far from
the centre of interest; so I made up my mind to put up with anything in
the shape of accommodation in Ourga itself. I received a very kind and
truly Russian welcome from the Consul, M. Feodroff. The fact of my being
a total stranger, unprovided even with a letter of introduction to him,
appeared to make no difference. He had heard I was coming, so took it for
granted that I, like other travellers, would stay at the Consulate. On my
informing him of my desire to find, if possible, a lodging in the city
itself, he good-naturedly offered to do his best to help me, but added
that he doubted my being able to get anything comfortable, as there were
only seven European houses, and these so small that their accommodation
was naturally very limited. In the mean time he begged me to make myself
at home at his place.

The Consulate, I found, was quite a little colony in itself, consisting
of the men employed by the consul and their families, each having their
own quarters. One wing of the building was used as a post-office; for,
although on Chinese territory, the postal service across Mongolia and
through China to Peking and Tientsin is conducted entirely by Russians.
Besides the actual _personnel_ of the establishment, there was also a
guard of five Cossacks under the command of a non-commissioned officer.
In spite, however, of the attractions of the comfortable quarters I was
in, I reminded my hospitable host the very next day of his promise to
help me find a room in the city, so shortly after we drove into Ourga
together, with a mounted Cossack galloping on ahead, as is always the
case whenever the consul leaves his house. After a lot of persuasion
one of the merchants agreed to take me in as a boarder at his house,
and to give me half a room occupied by one of his _employés_. The next
day, therefore, saw me installed in what were to be my “diggings” during
my stay in the sacred city, and as they were in the very centre of the
busiest part of the place, I had not to go far in search of my subjects,
for I could almost get them by looking out of the window. The charge for
the accommodation, considering how rough it was, struck me as very dear
for Ourga; but I was informed that living in Mongolia is (for Europeans)
not cheap, as almost everything has to be brought from Siberia.

Ourga, or, as it is called by the Mongolians, “Bogdor Kurene”—which means
the settlement of the Bogdor—though it contains nearly fifteen thousand
inhabitants, cannot even by the wildest stretch of the imagination be
called a city with any architectural pretensions to beauty. With the
exception of the Chinese portions of it—only a small part—its streets
consist of mere rows of high wooden palisades, which enclose the space
in the centre of which is erected the inevitable yourt; for so nomadic
is the Mongol by nature that, even when settled here in the capital, his
old instincts compel him to continue dwelling in his original tent.
The effect, therefore, of these long monotonous rows of rough logs,
relieved at regular intervals by tall wooden doors, all exactly of the
same pattern, is indescribably dreary; and, were it not for the two or
three large open spaces where a bazaar is daily held, there would be but
little to see, for Ourga has but few “lions.” There is really only one
building of any pretension in the place, and that is the large wooden
Buddhist temple which enshrines the huge gilt-bronze figure dedicated to
the apostle “Maidha.”

Either the Mongols don’t know or won’t tell—most probably the former,
but, at any rate, I was unable to find out anything about this mysterious
figure, or how or when the immense mass of metal was brought to the
desert city. It is certainly not less than forty feet in height, and is
in the familiar seated position in which Buddha is always represented.
In fact, I should have taken it for that divinity had not my informant,
a Mongol, insisted on its representing “Maidha,” who, I afterwards
learned, is one of the Mongol Buddhist apostles, and one much prayed to
in Mongolia. The body and extremities of this immense figure are draped
in yellow silk, and are almost lost in the surrounding obscurity; but
the face itself, which is surmounted by a majestic crown, is lighted up
by a hidden window in front of it; so it stands out in foreshortened
relief against the darkness of the dome, which gives it a certain weird
appearance that is somewhat increased by the eyes being painted a natural
colour.

Still, Ourga is most interesting, representing as it does one of
the standpoints of the Mongol Buddhist faith, and the capital of a
fast disappearing nation; for here is the abode of that most holy of
holy personages, the “Bogdor of Kurene,” and long and weary are the
pilgrimages frequently made by devout Mongols for a glimpse of this
mysterious man, who occupies in their faith almost the same position
as the pope does, or rather did in former times, to the Catholics. It
is for this reason that Ourga is spoken of as a sacred city, and ranks
immediately after the mystic capital of Thibet, Lhassa, where is the
abode of the prophet of Buddha, the living God, the mighty Dalai Lama,
and which is yet a forbidden place to unbelievers.

[Illustration: A PILGRIM FROM THIBET.]

The Bogdor of Kurene is a sort of branch establishment, in Ourga, of the
head office at Lhassa; for all Bogdor are supplied exactly of the same
youthful age, when required, by the Dalai Lama himself. It is difficult
to learn what are the special aptitudes necessary for this high position,
for the average Mongol is very reticent on matters concerning his faith;
but, at any rate, whatever they may be, the Bogdor seems to have a very
good time of it here, for he has little or nothing to do but to live
on the fat of the land and to say prayers all day. What more can a man
want? He has no voice in municipal and State matters, which are conducted
entirely by a Manchurian general, representing China, and by a Mongolian
prince. There is, however, just one little drawback to being so august a
personage. If the Bogdor conducts himself as his numerous Lamas consider
he ought to do, all goes well; but unfortunately youth will have, or
tries to have, its fling, and even a Bogdor is, after all, only an
ordinary mortal; so when, as has been usually the case up to now, the
youth, arrived at years of discretion, wished to meddle in affairs which
did not concern him, or to indulge in pleasures not consonant with his
austere position, he suddenly died; he was snuffed out, so to speak, how
or when was never known, nor were any questions asked; and in course of
time another Bogdor arrived from Lhassa to take his place, and perchance
also to meet the same fate. Very few of these holy youths have lived much
beyond the age of twenty. The first of the line, two hundred years ago,
however, was an exception, for he died a natural death, at the advanced
age of seventy; he evidently knew how to take care of himself. The
present representative, who is twenty-two years old, is likely, I hear,
to prove another exception; for it is said that he is of a very different
stamp to his predecessors, and is, for a Mongol, a most enlightened man,
taking a great interest in all modern subjects and inventions. He has
even had his photo taken (for strictly private circulation only), and has
a piano in his palace, which was presented to him by a former Russian
consul here.

Although to obtain an audience of the great man is, for a European,
an absolute impossibility, still he can often be seen; for he rides
out constantly, and on several occasions I have seen him, accompanied
by his suite. In fact, the first of these occasions formed rather an
amusing incident, and may be interesting. Seated on horseback, I was
one afternoon busy making a sketch near his palace, when suddenly I
heard shouting, and, looking round, saw that the people near were trying
to draw my attention to a sort of cavalcade, preceded by two horsemen
bearing a huge white silk standard, approaching me, and which I had
not until then noticed. To start a fresh sketch was the impulse of the
moment, for it was a gallant sight, which almost recalled the Middle
Ages. The costumes were really gorgeous. In the centre of the main group
was a pale-faced youth dressed in bright yellow silk, the crown of
his fur-trimmed hat covered with gold, which glittered like a halo on
his head. Although I had some idea that he must be some very exalted
personage, in spite of the frantic shouting of the people around, I went
on quietly with my sketch, just for the fun of seeing the adventure out.
In a few seconds they were close to me, when, to my astonishment, they
all galloped up to where I was, and I was surrounded by a curious and
inquisitive crowd, who had probably never seen a sketch-book before. The
pale-faced youth, who looked something like an Englishman got up for a
fancy-dress ball, appeared to be the most interested in my proceedings,
and put several questions to me in Mongol, which, of course, were
unintelligible to me, so I replied in Russian, saying I was an Englishman
and did not understand Mongolian. Evidently this was considered a capital
joke, although I had not intended to be humorous; for they all laughed
heartily for a few moments, and then some one said something to the
pale-faced youth, and they continued their ride. Immediately they were
gone the people came up, and, pointing to the horsemen, said, “Bogdor!
Bogdor!” in a reverential sort of way, making signs that the youth with
the gold roof to his hat was that august person himself. So I suppose
I can claim the honour of being the first European who has had an
“interview” with this inaccessible personage.

The Bogdor of Kurene is supported on the same principle as are some of
the London hospitals—that is, by “voluntary contributions only;” yet so
fervent are the Mongols in all matters connected with their religion,
that the amount of donations of all sorts which annually reach him is
sufficient to support him and his numerous suite of Lamas in a grand
and fitting style. All is grist which comes to the Bogdor’s mill; so
everything, however small, is acceptable, and the poorest Mongol can
offer his humble tribute.

[Illustration: A LAMA.]

By the way, I was much struck by the number of Lamas I met everywhere
in Mongolia; almost every other man seemed one. On inquiring, however,
I found that, although there are so many, most of them are only so in
name, but a comparatively small proportion are really priests. It is
customary, out of every family where there are several sons, to make at
least one of them a Lama. From his earliest childhood his head is shaved,
this being the great distinguishing outward mark between the Lamas and
ordinary individuals; and though, perhaps, he may not in after life serve
as a priest, still he can never marry. The title of Lama, therefore, in
most cases, is but a very empty one, and carries nothing with it except
the obligation to wear always yellow and red, and to dispense with the
pigtail and many other comforts of life.

Still, I could not help feeling that the Mongols are, in their way, a
very religious people, and, as I have remarked before, their devotions
form an important item in their daily routine; though, perhaps, to an
unbeliever in the Mongol Buddhist faith, these devotions may seem to
take a form which is somewhat astonishing. Still, it cannot be denied
they are carried out with great sincerity. Among the principal features
of Ourga are the “prayer-wheels,” which are placed for public use in
most of the big open spaces. These wheels, or rather hollow wooden
cylinders, are placed under cover of rough wooden sheds, and present at
first sight a very curious appearance. Most of them are covered with
Thibetan inscriptions, and all are completely filled with prayers written
on pieces of paper. In order to pray, all that is necessary—beyond,
of course, a sincere faith in what you are doing—is to walk round and
round inside the shed, and turn the cylinder with you; the more turns
the better. Many of the old people, while operating the large wheel
with one hand, at the same time diligently turn a small portable one
with the other; a rosary suspended from the wrist is also considered
an almost indispensable adjunct. Many of the wheels were very large, so
that several people could pray together; but most of them were small,
and evidently were only used for private communion, the sheds in many
instances being decorated with odds and ends of silk and bits of rags,
intended as offerings to Buddha.

[Illustration: A PRAYER-WHEEL, OURGA.]

Apart from the wheels are the “prayer-boards,” also placed for public
use in various parts of the city, and on which are continually to be
seen prostrate figures lying on their faces, and thus literally humbling
themselves to the very dust. From a little distance, these boards
presented a very ludicrous appearance, which so reminded me of the
familiar spring-board in a swimming-bath that I never passed them without
an inward grin—if you can imagine what that is—for any outward sign of
mirth at the strange proceedings would probably have got me into trouble.
The whole action of the people using them was exactly like that of a
person preparing to make a run along the board and take a “header” rather
than a prelude to a devotional exercise.

[Illustration: PRAYER-BOARDS, OURGA.]

I don’t think I was ever in a more strangely religious place than Ourga.
Everywhere, at the most unexpected places, at all times, one often saw
people throwing themselves suddenly face downwards, full length on the
ground, saying their prayers, just as the fit took them, I suppose, these
curious proceedings attracting no attention. Many a time I have been
riding quietly along, when all of a sudden my horse would be made to
swerve violently by some hideous old man or woman, who was seized with
an irresistible impulse to say a prayer just in front of its feet. And
their devotions do not end here, for every yourt, however humble, not
only contains a family wheel, but is decorated outside with innumerable
“prayer-flags,” or rather bits of rag, tied on to strings suspended from
poles all round the palisades. Till I was informed what they were, I took
them for bird-scares, for they could not, even by the wildest stretch
of the imagination, be taken for flags. If the Mongols were only a
quarter as industrious in ordinary everyday pursuits as they are in their
religion, the Chinese would not, as they do, monopolize all the trade of
the country, while its inhabitants sit about on their hams twirling their
prayer-wheels or manipulating their rosaries, quite content if they only
earn enough to keep them from day to day.

The sight of a nation’s decadence is always a saddening spectacle; but
that of the once so powerful Mongol race being gradually but surely
extinguished, by the people they once conquered, is a still further and
overwhelming instance of Darwin’s theory of the survival of the fittest.
Although, beyond the annual rearing of a few ponies, camels, and cattle
by some of the richer families, there is no actual industry, and the
bulk of the populace live from hand to mouth, there are but few signs
of actual want. Of course there are poor, wretchedly poor, people in
Ourga, who live, or, rather, manage to exist, in the most awful hovels.
But still, during the whole month I spent in the sacred city, I was
never once pestered by a beggar; indeed, I never saw one. Ourga, in this
respect, offered an agreeable contrast to most of the Siberian towns
I was in, where one could never leave one’s hotel or lodgings without
finding quite a little crowd of them lying in wait. Whether this is a
relic of the old national pride, I cannot, of course, tell, but I give it
as a curious and remarkable fact.

[Illustration: “THE OLD, OLD STORY ALL THE WOULD OVER.”

[_To face p. 246._]

The absence of beggars was, however, but the one redeeming feature of
this dirty and disappointing city—or, rather, I don’t think that this
could be called a redeeming feature, for it was more than counterbalanced
by the immense quantity of dogs with which the place is infested—huge
fierce brutes, more like wild beasts than domestic animals. They are not
unlike certain breeds of Scotch collies, only considerably larger. Till
I went to Ourga, I used to be fond of “the friend of man;” but I had not
been long in the sacred city before I got to hate the very sight of dogs.
At night it was absolutely impossible to work owing to the incessant
barking they kept up; at all times it was dangerous to venture out unless
one was armed with a heavy stick. Although it would not be a difficult
matter to exterminate these pests, they are left to increase unmolested;
so it is not to be wondered at that every street is blocked with them, to
the great danger of passengers.

These dogs do not confine their attentions entirely to strangers, the
inhabitants themselves fearing them as much as the Europeans do. It will
give some idea of the size and ferocity of the brutes when I add that
only a short time ago an old woman, passing through a by-street, was
set upon by a pack of them, and actually torn to pieces and devoured,
in broad daylight, before any assistance could reach her. Nor is this
an isolated instance, for not many years since an old Lama was riding
through the city late at night, when he was literally dragged off his
horse and killed. Very few of the inhabitants think of going out in the
streets at night, unless they have very important business, and then very
seldom alone.

One of the worst _mauvais quarts-d’heure_ I think I ever had was
one afternoon here, when, accompanied by a Russian friend, who spoke
a little English, I was returning from a stroll around. In order to
make a short cut, we passed through a number of narrow back streets,
and while going along the very narrowest of these we suddenly heard a
sort of hoarse murmur behind us, which was quickly getting nearer. On
looking back to see what it was, we saw a big cloud of dust, and in the
midst of it a huge crowd of dogs, coming towards us at full speed, with
one wretched-looking brute on ahead of them, which they were evidently
chivying. The few people in the street made a rush for their doors, and
got inside their enclosure without much hesitation. “It is a mad dog!”
exclaimed my companion, at the same time pulling me close to the palisade
behind us, which was flush with the road. We stood with our backs to it,
as flat as we could make ourselves, and in less time than it takes to
tell it the whole pack were abreast of us, with the poor hunted beast,
covered with blood and dirt, snapping and biting viciously right and
left at his tormentors as he flew past. Fortunately for us, they were
too occupied to direct their energies in our direction, though they
actually had to squeeze by us, so narrow was the street. I did not feel
comfortable again until some little time after they were out of sight.

The savage nature of these brutes will be more readily understood when
it is remembered that the Mongols, in accordance with their creed,
literally throw their dead to their dogs, and never bury them. Old or
young, rich or poor, the custom is universal, forming as it does part
and parcel of their religion. When a Mongol dies, the body is wrapped
up in an old coat and is taken a short distance outside the city on to
the hills, where it is placed on the ground, with only a “prayer-flag”
over it to protect it, and is then abandoned, not to the mercy of the
elements, but to the hundreds of dogs who have already scented their
feast and are waiting patiently by. No sooner are the mourners out of
sight than the dreadful repast commences, and in an incredibly short time
nothing remains of the lifeless body but a few scraps of the covering
it was rolled in. A general battle usually takes place over the body
among the savage brutes, with the result that human remains are soon
strewed over the ground, and the scene is too ghastly for description.
As there is no cemetery or particular spot for depositing the dead, one
not infrequently comes across a stray bone or a skull which has escaped
those hungry canine sextons, and these poor vestiges of frail humanity
certainly add to the desolate surroundings of the desert city. Such a
wonderful instinct have the Ourga dogs, that I am told they will often
wait for days outside a yourt where a person is dying.

The currency of Mongolia is peculiar, and takes a lot of getting used
to. On one occasion I bought some trifling article and paid for it
in Russian money, which the Mongols are, at any rate, shrewd enough
never to refuse. Imagine my surprise when, for the change, I was handed
a small slab of brick-tea and two dirty little bits of floss silk,
which I should have passed unnoticed in the gutter. These rags, which
intrinsically were probably worth less than a farthing, represented
twenty kopeks (sixpence), as I was informed, while the tea was equivalent
to thirty kopeks. This tea, by the way, is the only real currency
throughout Mongolia; the silk is becoming gradually obsolete, probably
because it wears out too soon, whereas the tea will stand almost any
amount of hard wear. A “brick” of tea, sixteen inches long by eight wide
and about one and a half thick, represents sixty kopeks, equal to one
shilling and sixpence. If a smaller sum is necessary, the brick is cut
up into sections, say, six of ten kopeks each, and even these are again
subdivided by the poorer Mongols.

It is curious to note that, although Mongolia is really Chinese
territory, everything is Russian, so to speak; and even the tea and silk
represent an equivalent in Russian and not Chinese money. Some of the
Russian merchants in Ourga have even adopted a sort of private banknote
system, so as to do away with the bother of having to keep a large stock
of loose cash—that is, of “bricks”—always handy. These notes represent
so many bricks each, and are redeemable on demand; but I hear that the
Mongols prefer the bulky article to the flimsy paper substitute. When,
after a time, this currency becomes injured by hard usage, and chipped
round the edges, it is used for the usual purposes of tea, and it may be
imagined what a delightful beverage it makes after it has been passing
from hand to hand for some months among the dirty Mongols! However, these
children of the desert are not fastidious, and the greasy-looking stuff
is broken up and literally put to stew in the common cauldron of the
yourt, where, eaten with millet seed, it makes a dish much appreciated
for some days.

This dish is to the Mongol what the samovar is to the Russian, and if one
is on intimate terms enough to visit a “big man” in his yourt, almost
the first thing he offers you is a basin of tea, which is usually poured
out of a metal jug begrimed with the dirt of generations. I remember on
one occasion, accompanied by a friend who spoke Mongolian, visiting a
Mongol who was rather a swell in his way, for his yourt, which I had been
anxious to see, was fitted up with some pretension to “style.” We seated
ourselves in the usual manner, on the floor, and our host, after a few
minutes of conversation, of course offered us the inevitable tea. This
was what I wanted particularly to avoid, but there was no getting out
of it this time. A particularly unwholesome-looking old hag then dived
into the gloomy recesses of a sort of cupboard, and produced three wooden
bowls containing some greasy-looking compound, which she forthwith
proceeded to clean out with her grimy fingers, finishing up by polishing
them vigorously with the tail of her gown; these tasty receptacles were
then placed before us on the ground, and filled with some vile liquid
which bore no more resemblance to the “cup which cheers but does not
inebriate” than does the proverbial chalk to the proverbial cheese. It
would have been an insult to the man to have refused his hospitality, so
for the next five minutes I was racking my brain how to get out of even
sipping the awful stuff. My companion, who was used to Mongolian customs,
was not so delicate in his tastes, and managed to get through his bowl
all right, at the same time advising me to try and do likewise, so as not
to offend the man. Providentially at this moment some one came to the
door of the yourt to speak to our host, and we all got up, I immediately
taking advantage of the opportunity to quietly empty the contents of my
bowl into a dark corner near me. We shortly after took our leave, in
spite of the old Mongol’s pressing invitation to stay and have a drop
more tea; and when we got outside the yourt, my companion, who had not
noticed my manœuvres, but had observed the empty bowl, remarked that he
knew I should like Mongol tea if I once tried it!

[Illustration: IN THE CAMEL AND PONY BAZAAR, OURGA.

[_To face p. 293._]

It was fortunate I had plenty of work to occupy me, for there was little
or nothing to do but to stroll round about a sort of market-place,
where a bazaar was daily held, and where everything almost could be
bought—Mongolian, of course. This market alone offered almost endless
scope for my pencil, for it always presented interesting scenes. One part
was devoted to camels and ponies, and it was amusing to watch the zeal
displayed by the owners of some promising lot when a likely purchaser
appeared. When I was at Ourga one could get a very decent-looking pony
for about two pounds (sixteen roubles), which was not dear, considering;
for I don’t think it is possible to get anything really good for less
anywhere—this, I believe, will be conceded. In Southern Mongolia, in
the district bordering on China, these serviceable little animals
fetch much higher prices, especially if they show any sign of speed;
and the district at certain times of the year is overrun with agents
from Shanghai and Tientsin racing-men on the look-out for promising
“griffins,”[1] and comparatively big sums of money are paid for them.
Apart from racing purposes, the Mongolian ponies make capital hacks when
trimmed up a bit and knocked into shape. I could hardly believe that the
smart, well-fed, carefully groomed animals I saw in Peking, Tientsin, and
Shanghai were originally rough, unkempt brutes of the desert, so great
was the transformation.

Another part of the market would be occupied by vendors of saddlery, an
important and flourishing department, as well it might be, considering
what indefatigable horsemen the Mongols are. But what always struck me as
being the most unique part of the motley gathering, and a sight almost
worth going to Ourga to see, was the hat-bazaar, a department entirely in
the hands of the fair sex. A Mongol’s hat is, perhaps, the most striking
feature of his toilet; and a rich man will often spend a large sum on
his fur-trimmed head-gear. There is very little to distinguish a lady’s
from a gentleman’s, only a tassel or two behind, and as, owing to their
peculiar shape, no particular difference in size is necessary, there is
any number to select from. The noisy crowd of chattering females, dressed
in their quaint costume, with their multi-coloured stock-in-trade, was
undoubtedly one of the most interesting sights of Ourga; and often did
I hover around them with my sketch-book in hand. But although it was
a quiet and inoffensive crowd in the bazaar, it was certainly a very
curious and inquisitive one; and at first it was very trying to my temper
to find myself suddenly the centre of a group of dirty, evil-smelling
Mongols, who were not satisfied with mere observation of my movements,
but would actually maul me all over with their hot grimy fingers to
ascertain of what stuff my clothes were made, my corduroy coat especially
coming in for the largest share of public attention. After a time,
however, I got used to these practices, and usually found that the best
way to put a stop to them was to catch hold of the man nearest me, and to
begin turning him about, as I was being treated myself, and to examine
him as though he were for sale. This nearly always raised a good-humoured
laugh. If, however, it did not succeed in so doing, I had another plan,
which I reserved as my _grande finale_, and which rarely failed, for the
time, to rid me of the unpleasant crowd. I would take out my pipe and
slowly fill it, every movement I made being watched with rapt attention
by the bystanders; then I would produce a small magnifying-glass I always
carried about me and proceed to light up with the aid of the sun—no
difficult or lengthy an operation on a hot morning. This seemingly
mysterious feat would simply strike the onlookers dumb with amazement,
and they would generally draw back instinctively a few paces. I would
then walk quietly away, leaving them to unravel the mystery as best they
could.

[_To face p. 295._]

Still, in spite of its uncivilized condition, there is yet some show
of keeping order in the city, although the poor, inoffensive Mongols
never struck me as having it in them to be guilty of any big acts of
violence; petty larceny maybe, but nothing more than that, for they
don’t seem to have pluck enough left to do anything really bad. There
is, however, a fairly large body of police to represent law and public
authority; these look after the place by day, and during the dark hours
watchmen with gongs parade the street, and combine with the dogs to make
night hideous. Besides these varied arrangements, there is a regiment
of Chinese soldiers quartered on the outskirts of the town, forming a
sort of body-guard to the Chinese resident general, who represents the
suzerainty of the First Cousin of the Moon, over the Mongol Tartars, and
who, in conjunction with the Mongol prince, constitutes the Government of
the whole territory, for the Bogdor’s power is merely spiritual, and he
has actually nothing to do with the management of State affairs.

Still, I could not help feeling how much more under Russian than Chinese
influence everything was in Mongolia. For instance, the consul at Ourga
was undoubtedly a far more important personage than even the Chinese
general himself, and from what I learnt, I believe the late consul, M.
Shismaroff, was practically the leading man of Ourga, for he was not only
very much esteemed and looked up to by the Mongols, but was actually
consulted by them in most State affairs. The fact of all the trade of the
country being virtually in the hands of the Russians may to a certain
extent account for this ascendancy; but be it what it may, one thing is
certain, that a Cossack cap inspires an incredible amount of respect in
these distant regions, not only among the Mongols, but also the Chinese
themselves; for there seems to be, as far as I could make out, a pretty
general apprehension, or rather conviction, of what would happen were
a subject of the Czar to be offered any insult. During my subsequent
journey through China I was much struck with the difference of the
footing on which English and other nationalities are placed with regard
to the Chinese.

The days in Ourga passed by very slowly indeed, and had it not been for
the work I had laid myself out to get through, the month I spent in the
sacred city would have been very dreary indeed, for the whole time I
was there but one event occurred to break the eternal monotony of the
stagnant existence.

This was the annual commemoration of the festival of the Maidha, on
April 23, the most important of yearly celebrations among the Mongol
Buddhists. For days beforehand the city was in the throes of preparation,
the various markets were shifted to other temporary quarters, and the
streets through which the procession was to pass were invaded by hordes
of youngsters, whose mission was to clean up the roads as much as
possible—and it was no easy matter, considering that they are all used as
open sewers. The mode of procedure was certainly novel, if nothing else.
The bulk of the filth was swept into big heaps, and shovelled into dried
bullock-hides, to which ropes were fastened. A dreary sort of chorus was
then started, and the load was dragged away and deposited on some other
road, generally only a few yards distant.

The appointed day arrived, and from an early hour the populace thronged
the different open spaces where the best view of the proceedings could
be obtained. Fortunately, the weather was fine, so the _coup-d’œil_
was very animated and interesting; the procession—which was really
three processions moving abreast—was certainly most imposing in effect,
and quite Oriental in the brilliancy of the colours displayed. It was
composed exclusively of Lamas, and, from the length of it, gave me a fair
idea how many of these men there are in the capital alone. On all sides
were to be seen huge waving banners, with strange devices on them, and
surmounted by still stranger carvings; immense coloured umbrellas, on
stands, each drawn by several men; also crowds fantastically attired,
marching along, beating large drums shaped like big warming-pans, others
blowing musical instruments of forms and shapes impossible to describe;
while in the centre of this immense moving crowd was a huge sort of
trophy, on wheels, and surmounted by a large wooden horse, painted red,
and sheltered from the rays of the sun by a big multi-coloured umbrella
fixed over it. This was evidently the _pièce de résistance_, for it
towered high above all the rest. Close behind it, surrounded by a crowd
of the highest Lamas, was a bright yellow sedan-chair, in which reclined
the sacred Bogdor himself.

[Illustration: AN OURGA BEAUTY.

[_To face p. 299._]

The procession, making a tour of the city, with certain halts at
different spots, either for refreshment or religious observance—I could
not quite make out which, probably both—occupied the greater part of the
day, many of the rests being for as long as an hour, all the men then
squatting on the ground in lines round the centre trophy. I managed to
get a very good view of the early part of these proceedings from the roof
of a friend’s house, and then took my horse, and rode through the crowd
to inspect it more closely. I don’t think I ever saw a more gorgeous
display of costumes and jewellery. Some of the women were dressed in the
richest of silks, and were literally one mass of silver decorations from
head to foot; back and front, every available part was covered with the
very quaintest ornaments imaginable, till they had the appearance of
walking jewellery shops—and they seemed not the least afraid of being
robbed while pushing their way through the crowd. Of course, most of
the _élite_ were on horseback, and it was curious to notice how, even
in far-away Ourga, “the old, old story” is still the same; for I saw
many really pretty girls surrounded by quite a little crowd of admirers,
flirting away just like their sisters in the civilized world.

One touch of nature makes the whole world kin, and for a moment I felt
quite lonely at not knowing any of them, and being able to join in the
fun. The days following all this animation were very dull indeed, and I
could not help thinking that even a few more religious processions would
have helped to liven dreary Ourga up a bit. As it was, I found myself
eagerly looking forward to my journey across the desert to the Great
Wall; and had I been able to curtail my stay, I certainly should have
done so, but——




CHAPTER XXIV.

FROM OURGA TO THE GREAT WALL.

    My preparations for the journey across the Gobi Desert—The
    Russian Heavy Mail—My camel-cart—Good-bye to Ourga—The first
    few days out—Discomforts of the journey—The homeward-bound
    mail—The desert settlement of Tcho-Iyr.


[Illustration: IN THE GOBI DESERT.]

It was one thing getting to Ourga, quite another getting out of it, as I
found when I made inquiries as to the most expeditious way of crossing
the immense waste which lay between me and the Great Wall of China; it
was, in fact, mainly owing to this circumstance that I stayed so long in
the dreary city, for when I spoke to my Russian friends on the subject,
they shook their heads, and expressed an opinion that I would not find
it an easy matter to make up so small a caravan as I should require for
the journey. And so it proved. Moreover, much to my annoyance, I learnt
that there was not one really reliable Mongol in Ourga at the time, and
that to think of going alone with doubtful guides would have been to
tempt Providence. I was, therefore, advised to make the best of it and
postpone my departure for a while, on the chance of something turning up.
At length the Russian postmaster, with whom I was on very friendly terms,
came to my rescue, and kindly offered to let me accompany the caravan
of the Russian Heavy Mail as far as Peking. This was indeed a bit of
luck, for the convoy is not only always accompanied by two experienced
Cossacks, but does the journey in considerably less time than any
ordinary caravan, and my expenses would also be very much lessened.

As the time for my departure approached, my preparations for the long and
tedious journey required a good deal of attention, for nothing can be
purchased _en route_. Much to my disappointment, I learned that I should
not be able to take my horse with me, as there would be no means of
getting sufficient food for him, even if he could stand the long forced
marches, for it is only by having relays of fresh camels that the mail
can get across so quickly as it does. I had taken the precaution to bring
out with me from England a sufficient quantity of tinned provisions to
last me right across Siberia and leave me enough for my desert journey. I
had also a small American cooking-stove, which the makers (Messrs. Poore
and Co., of Cheapside, London) guaranteed would work equally well with
coal, wood, or _argol_ (dried camel-dung, the fuel of the desert), and
this portable kitchener proved absolutely invaluable; even in wind or
rain it worked to perfection, and many were the delicacies it afforded
me.

[Illustration: MY CAMEL-CART.

[_To face p. 303._]

Having overhauled my stock of provisions, my next trouble was to get
a cart to travel in, or rather to sleep in, for I was then under the
illusion that I should spend the greater part of the daytime on the back
of one of our “ships of the desert.” I was soon, however, undeceived;
I had forgotten what a bad sailor I am. A camel-cart, as will be seen
from my sketch, is of peculiar construction, and I do not think it is
possible accurately to describe one of these boxes of torture without
going into profanity. No matter how smooth or level may be the road, the
camel-cart bumps and jolts about as vigorously as when it is passing
over rocks, and the smallest pebble under the wheels will send a spasm
through the whole vehicle like an electric shock; in fact, I could not
help coming to the conclusion that, were a camel-cart to pass over the
smoothest asphalt road, it would be affected by the geological sub-strata
and jolt accordingly. There was one thing I discovered beyond a question
of a doubt whilst crossing the Gobi in this camel-cart, and that was,
that I possessed, under certain conditions, a thorough command of my
mother tongue. I managed to hire one of these conveyances, for to have
one built expressly is a very expensive affair, and would have taken some
little time. I also had to hire an extra camel from the Mongol who runs
the mail, for the postmaster only undertook to provide me with one for
my baggage, so I had to get another expressly to draw my cart—no easy
matter, as I soon found out, for it is not every one of these brutes
that will allow himself to be harnessed; and when they don’t at once
condescend to walk between the shafts, no manner of persuasion will
ever induce them to do so. With a camel whipping is simply out of the
question; for, immediately one attempts to chastise him, he either lies
down, and refuses to get up, or else starts kicking. Till I went to
Mongolia I had always thought that the camel was the most patient and
docile of animals. I soon, however, saw that for absolute bad temper and
stubbornness he has not his equal anywhere; and, as added to these gentle
traits of character, nature has also provided him with a unique and
disgusting means of defence, in the form of a power to spit, or rather
eject, almost on the slightest provocation, a mass of undigested food,
at any one who may be unlucky enough to incur his displeasure, it may be
imagined that he is seldom interfered with by strangers, owing to the
risk of receiving one of these odoriferous discharges. No less than six
camels were tried before one could be found which was deemed reliable
enough to draw the cart, and this had to be bought for the purpose. The
value of these brutes varies according to their age; full-grown ones
generally average from 160 to 200 roubles (£20 to £25).

The Mongolian dromedary, or rather camel—for it has two humps—is a
very different-looking animal to its Arabian cousin, for it is very
much smaller, and in winter covered with a long and shaggy coat of
hair. During the summer months this coat comes off, and the animal then
presents an even more unpleasant appearance than usual, which, however,
in summer or winter, is thoroughly in harmony with that of the Mongol
attendants.

The caravan of the Russian Heavy Mail usually consists of the two
Cossacks in charge of it, three Mongols, and six camels. If the mail be
an exceptionally heavy one, an extra camel is perhaps added; but this
occurs very seldom. It is, in reality, the Parcel Post, for only heavy
matter is sent by it. Letters are conveyed across the Gobi by horse post,
which goes three times a month both ways, on a system not unlike the
old pony express in America, the distance of one thousand miles, from
Kiakhta to Kalgan, being covered in the short time of nine days by five
consecutive riders and nine relays of horses. Only Mongols are employed
on this arduous task, and night and day, in all weathers and seasons,
these hardy sons of the desert do their monotonous and lonely journey,
keeping their time with almost the regularity of clockwork, so well is
the system organized. They go at a hard gallop the whole way, the mail
being carried in saddle-bags, slung over a second horse, which they lead
with them. The difference in the time occupied by the heavy and the light
posts is naturally very considerable, the caravans taking as much as
seventeen and eighteen days to do the distance from Ourga to Kalgan, and
this even with four different relays of camels on the way. Still, this
is very much quicker than the ordinary tea-caravans can do it, for it is
no unusual occurrence for twenty-five, thirty, or even as much as forty
days to be spent on the journey across. The great difference, of course,
between the mail and the private caravan is that the latter has the
same camels to go the whole way; so a road has to be taken which passes
through the district most likely to afford pasturage to the animals.
As, owing to the number of caravans passing, these pastures are yearly
becoming more remote, the roads, in consequence, are getting longer for
the ordinary caravans, for they have to go further afield in search of
grass. The two Cossacks who went in charge of the mail I accompanied were
both men who had had much experience on the road, the leader, Nicolaieff,
having been eleven years continually passing to and fro across the Gobi,
so he knew almost every inch of the ground.

[Illustration: MONGOL CONVEYING THE RUSSIAN LIGHT MAIL ACROSS THE GOBI
DESERT.

[_To face p. 306._]

I could not help wondering what inducement the dreary Mongolian waste
could offer to any young and active man, for him to elect to pass his
life in it, so to speak; for, although the same Cossacks accompany the
mail right across China, as far even as Tientsin, they only stay long
enough there for the contrast of the life in the busy town to appear
even more marked in comparison with their own monotonous existence. Yet
there are men, in most cases married, who actually give up the best years
of their lives in this obscure and remote postal service—and for what?
The Cossack Nicolaieff received, I learnt, the munificent sum of twenty
roubles (£2 10_s._) per month, out of which he had to keep himself and
family! Stepanoff, who was his junior, received somewhat less. Of course,
it must not be forgotten that living is cheap in these parts. Still,
12_s._ 6_d._ per week is not a big sum to keep a large family on.

It has seldom been my luck to come across two such thoroughly good
fellows as these humble Cossacks, and it was with a real feeling of
regret that I separated from them at the end of the journey; for I
don’t think that I ever met two men working together in more absolute
harmony of friendship. There was none of the effusiveness one sees in
the higher walks of life, but there was, I noticed, a certain quiet and
unobtrusive steadfastness between them which meant volumes more than all
the “old chap” this or “old man” that could ever convey. Duty bound them
together, and with the implicit obedience to it which is an instinctive
quality in the character of the Russian soldier, they did their work
together like men and brothers.

It was with a feeling of relief that on May 7 I left the dreary desert
city of Ourga, though certainly not without some forebodings of the
hardships which would have to be endured before I reached civilization.
Eight hundred miles of sandy waste lay between me and the Great Wall of
China—a sandy waste which, for utter desolation and monotony, is probably
without an equal in the world. I do not propose to give a chronological
account of the tedious journey; events were so few and far between during
the long and tiresome marches that a description of the routine of one
day will suffice for all. The start for the day’s journey was usually
made at daybreak, when in a few seconds the sleeping encampment would
become a scene of bustle and movement. The dawn was scarcely visible in
a faint streak of rosy red on the horizon, when the drivers would be
awakened by the leader, and preparations at once made for the start.
All had to be repacked on the camels, and mine reharnessed to my cart,
everything being finished and ready to proceed in an incredibly short
space of time. No time whatever was wasted in toilet arrangements or even
refreshing the inner man, and, although I would often have given anything
for a cup of hot coffee or Bouillon Fleet before starting, I did not
like to disarrange the evidently invariable custom of making an early
start, by delaying the caravan for the preparation which the making of
such a beverage would have involved.

[Illustration: THE MIDDAY HALT IN THE DESERT.]

Long shall I remember those dreary, weary hours which always preceded our
first stoppage, for no halt was ever made until close on noon. A bite of
biscuit, perhaps some preserved icy-cold tinned meat, washed down by a
limited quantity of stale water sucked through a pocket-filter, was my
only breakfast—a breakfast so complete in its discomfort as to require
the very keenest appetite to do justice to it. The appetite I fortunately
usually possessed, for the bracing air of the desert acted on one like
the strongest tonic. The noonday halt after seven or eight hours of
incessant jolting in the cart was a veritable oasis in the discomfort
of the day, as at this time I could make at least some attempt at an
imitation of a civilized meal. At this time also the benefit of my little
portable stove was simply inestimable; it fairly astonished the simple
Mongol. Still, even this attempt at a square meal was never unattended by
discomfort, for in the middle of the day a cold piercing easterly wind
was invariably blowing, and, although the Cossacks always pitched their
tent, the open air was preferable to its smoky, malodorous interior with
a fire in the centre. Two hours and a half were usually the limit of time
allowed for the midday rest; then the boys would be sent off to fetch
back the camels, which would often stray far away from the encampment
in search of pasturage. Then the tent was struck, loads readjusted,
the caravan marshalled into its usual order, with my cart leading, and
once more we started on another dreary and monotonous spell, which only
terminated late at night.

Our rate of progression, even under the most favourable conditions,
never exceeded three and a half miles an hour. It was usually managed so
that we should have reached a well when we halted; still, the precaution
was always taken of filling our water-barrels whenever the opportunity
offered, so as not to have to rely on doing the exact distances between
the wells. These distances varied very considerably from fifteen up to
even thirty miles; but the water varied still more. I thought, when I was
up-country in Africa, that I had drunk the most repulsive water it would
ever be my lot to have to put up with, but I had not then been in the
Gobi Desert. Even my pocket-filter on one or two occasions gave it up
as a bad job, for it got so clogged with dirt that it would not act, so
I had then to throw aside the remains of my fastidiousness and drink the
awful liquid in its natural state, which in appearance and consistency
was a cut between chocolate paste and coffee and milk; for _il y avait de
quoi boire et manger_. I could not help noticing how very slightly the
Cossacks were affected by these nasty incidents.

Long habit had acclimatized them, so to speak, to living in dirt, and
eating and drinking it also; they were quite Mongolized, in fact. On
one occasion, at the commencement of the journey, I remember going into
the tent when their dinner, a quantity of meat, was stewing, or rather
boiling, in the large iron pan over the open fire. The preparation was
a simple one, for the meat had been merely cut into chunks and thrown
into the pot and covered with water. As the mess boiled, a nasty scum,
consisting of all the dirt in the water and the meat, rose to the
surface. This filth was eagerly scooped up by both the Cossacks and
the Mongols, and swallowed with much avidity; in fact, I learned they
look upon it as the best part of the food, for when I expressed my
astonishment at their even leaving it in the stew, as it would be better
and cleaner if it were removed, they stared in blank surprise at what
they probably considered my ignorance. I was much surprised to notice how
very little water a camel requires when on the road, and how little he
gets given to him; even when there was an abundance they never received
it more often than once every two days, so as not to accustom them to
luxuries, and they did not seem to be very keen for it even then.

The first day after leaving Ourga was uneventful enough, the track
offering little or nothing of interest, though the actual flat sandy
expanse of desert had not yet commenced. The surrounding hills were bare
and desolate-looking, and the dreary aspect was a fitting prelude to the
unutterable solitude and desolation farther on. A few miles out from the
capital we crossed the broad, swiftly running Tola River. Our camels
were quite girth-deep in its waters, for there had been rain up in the
mountains recently; still, the animals did not seem much to mind crossing
it, breasting the current as unconcernedly as though they liked it. This
was the last water of any importance we saw until we reached Kalgan,
nearly three weeks after.

As we slowly advanced we gradually left the hills behind, till at last,
three days out, we reached the actual commencement of the great desert;
and I saw stretched out before me a vast, limitless waste, so flat and
unbroken that it looked exactly like the sea. A quiet, as though of
death, reigned over it, for not even the slightest sign of life broke the
oppressive stillness of the scene. Neither the Karoo or the Kalahari
deserts in South Africa ever produced on me an impression so weird and
indescribable as did that first glimpse of the awful Gobi, “The Great
Hungry Desert.” The mere look of the dreary waste recalled all I had ever
read of the horrors of a lingering death, by thirst or starvation, which
has so often befallen travellers who have been unfortunate enough to lose
themselves on its almost trackless surface. Nothing, in fact, was wanting
to complete the gloomy picture. Even the faintly marked trail before us
was rendered more easily discernable by the bleached bones of camels
lying here and there on either side.

[Illustration: MY CARAVAN IN THE DESERT.

(_From a Kodak photogragh._)]

Our fourth day out was marked by an event—for the slightest incident
in that weary, uneventful journey magnified itself into an important
occurrence. During the afternoon we met the caravan of the homeward-bound
Russian mail, and, considering we had not seen a living soul, except
each other, for more than forty-eight hours, it may be imagined how
pleasurable was the meeting. The two convoys halted for a time; our
Cossacks exchanged news with the other Cossacks, and even the Mongols
hobnobbed together; the inevitable vodka was produced, and, under
its genial influence, for a few moments the weariness of the journey
was forgotten; then, with many final shakes of the hand and friendly
wishes, we were under way, and in a short time were once more alone on
the boundless waste. It was on this occasion that I first heard of the
attempted assassination of the Czarewitch.

[Illustration: WE MEET THE HOMEWARD-BOUND MAIL.]

The next day we reached a range of rocky hills—great heaps of huge
boulders lay piled around in picturesque confusion, and, altogether, the
scene was a welcome change after the flatness of the plains. Right in
the very midst of these hills, nestling as it were under their shelter,
to my surprise we came upon a miniature town, which I had never even
heard of before. This, I learned, was Tcho-Iyr, a Lama settlement,
entirely inhabited by Mongols who are devoting their lives to religion.

[Illustration: THE LAMA SETTLEMENT OF TCHO-IYR IN THE GOBI DESERT.]

It was a lovely day, the finest one we had had as yet, and in the still
air and the eternal silence of the surroundings the effect was very
impressive, for it was indeed “asleep in the sunshine of the East,” and
“far from the busy haunts of men.” I therefore persuaded Nicolaieff to
halt the caravan for a short time, so that I could have a stroll around
the quaint little place, with my sketch-book and camera; and very pleased
was I afterwards that I had done so, for it was one of the prettiest
spots I saw in Mongolia. On a nearer inspection it turned out to be
larger than I had first taken it to be, and absolutely different from
what I expected to find, for the quiet pervading the streets was quite in
keeping with the proximity to the vast desert—there was, in fact, quite
the atmosphere of religious seclusion which one feels in a monastery. But
what struck me most was the wonderful cleanliness I saw everywhere, and I
don’t think that, for its size, I ever saw its equal. Everything looked
spick and span, as though it were cleaned carefully every day. There
was also a striking absence of dogs, those pests of Mongolia. One could
stroll about without being continually on the _qui vive_, as in Ourga.
Instead of a conglomeration of dirty yourts, there were trim, neatly
built, whitewashed cottages, of absolutely the same outward appearance as
English ones, not so large perhaps, but still strangely reminding one of
far-away England. Curiously enough, I did not see anything at all similar
to them anywhere else, either in Mongolia or China; nor could I find out
why this style of building was exclusively confined to the pretty little
desert settlement.

[Illustration: I TAKE TEA WITH A LAMA IN THE GOBI DESERT.

[_To face p. 316._]

My appearance naturally created quite an excitement, for I was probably
the first Englishman that has ever visited the place, which is, I
believe, out of the usual caravan route; and the appearance of a stranger
in their midst will doubtless form the subject of conversation for a
long time to come. Still, I was in no way annoyed—a little crowded
in, perhaps, but that I was beginning to get accustomed to, and the
half-hour I spent there was so pleasant that I really regretted having
to hurry away. Either there were no women in the place, or at least very
few, for I never saw them; the inhabitants appeared to be entirely of
the sterner sex, and all of them, from the very youngest, Lamas or Lama
students. The effect of the entire population being dressed in red and
yellow was very curious. Many of the older men wore massive gold-rimmed
spectacles, which gave them a very learned appearance. A couple of large
temples of Tibetan architecture, in excellent preservation, seemed the
most important buildings in the town, and, besides these, I learned,
there was a monastery. When I got back to the caravan, I found it quite
surrounded by visitors, for the news of our arrival had by this time
spread all over the place, and evidently a general half-holiday had been
taken in consequence.




CHAPTER XXV.

THE GOBI DESERT—_continued_.

    Sport in the desert—The “post-station” at Oud-en—The last of
    the desert—Saham-Balhousar—First impressions of China—Chinese
    women—Returning to sea-level—Curious experience—The eclipse of
    the moon—Arrival at Kalgan.


[Illustration: THE RUSSIAN POST-STATION IN MID-DESERT.]

Nothing of particular interest occurred during the next few days
after leaving Tcho-Iyr. To the low range of rocky hills surrounding
it succeeded a monotonous expanse of endless gravel-coloured plain,
which was positively depressing to one’s spirits. Day after day would
find us surrounded by the same unbroken horizon, while, with the
regularity of clockwork, at eleven o’clock every morning the piercing
cold north-easterly wind would commence blowing, and continue until late
in the afternoon, very often with the force of a strong gale. Owing,
I believe, to its being some four thousand feet above the sea-level,
the temperature of the great plateau of Mongolia is never high, even in
summer; but in winter the cold is excessive, almost as great as in any
part of Siberia, and the desert is covered with several feet of snow.

[Illustration: IN THE GOBI DESERT—A TEA CARAVAN ON ITS WAY TO SIBERIA.

(_From a Kodak photograph._)]

Although I had a Winchester rifle and a fowling-piece with me, and a
store of ammunition, the sport I managed to get never compensated me
for the bother of carting the heavy load about. During the whole time I
was in the desert I did not fire off more than one hundred rounds, and
these with but a very poor result; still, what I did get was large, and
helped to increase our larder. From what I saw, it struck me that there
is really very little sport to be got in the Gobi. It is true one often
saw in the distance many herds of antelope, but, owing to the flatness of
the country and the entire absence of cover, it was almost impossible to
get even within range of them. If I had been a dead shot at, say, eight
hundred or nine hundred yards, I might perhaps have done some execution,
but, unfortunately, I am not. There was also a species of bird something
like a very large wild goose, which the Cossacks called “Kuritze,” which
was splendid eating, not unlike venison. I managed to get some of these
with my rifle, as they were not so shy—one in particular must have
weighed twenty or thirty pounds, and it lasted us several days. Some
districts abounded with a curious animal not unlike a rabbit, which the
Mongols called “Tarbargan.” These were easily got, probably because they
were no good for eating purposes, even the Mongols refusing a couple I
shot. Other parts of the desert were simply covered with large mounds,
which the Cossacks told me were made by “Koshki,” a sort of wild cat
which burrows in the ground. I never, however, saw any of the animals,
though we were passing through their haunts for days. Small green lizards
seemed to thrive everywhere, even in the most arid places; in fact,
I don’t think I ever saw so many before. A peculiar kind of beetle,
which covered the ground in great numbers, seemed confined to a certain
district or undefined zone, for once out of it they disappeared. Often
in the early morning, when the sleeping caravan was aroused to prepare
for the start, wolves would be seen prowling around at a short distance
from us; but they always got away before I could get the sleep out of my
eyes and my rifle ready. So it cannot be said that animal life in the
Gobi is extensive enough to be considered good sport, or sufficient to
enliven the monotony of travelling across it. Of course, I am speaking
only from my experience on the caravan route; possibly in the more remote
districts of the vast waste, on the Manchurian side, are animals in
abundance, but they are too far away to be “get-at-able.”

On May 15 we reached a post-station which stands at a place called
“Oud-en,” exactly in mid-desert, consisting of a couple of yourts in
charge of a Russian. It would be impossible to imagine anything more
unutterably lonely and dreary than this little station. For miles before
we reached it the desert was simply a vast expanse of bare rocks, without
the slightest sign of vegetation to break the monotony of their dull
muddy-grey colour. It almost appeared as if the most bleak and wretched
spot had been purposely chosen for the “post-station,” for there was not
even a Mongolian yourt within miles, and even the nearest water was some
distance away. I could not help thinking that exile to the most far-away
Siberian villages would be preferable to the awful existence here, while
the life of the Cossacks in charge of the mail, continually on the march,
was one of positive gaiety compared to it. Still, the man living thus, of
his own free will, was no old, broken-down individual, looking as though
he were sick of the world, but a smart young fellow, with very little of
the hermit in his outward appearance; yet this is what to all intents and
purposes he is, and for the wretchedly small pay of thirty roubles (£3
10_s._) per month, out of which he had to keep himself! I learned that,
with the exception of a Mongolian servant, he was quite alone, and never
saw a soul except when the homeward or outward-bound mail passed once a
month. He had not got even a horse or a gun to help while away the time,
and his stock of books, the poor fellow told me, he had read through and
through many times during the three years he had spent in the station.

What an existence! It has often struck me that there are certain types of
men whose intelligence is so little above that of animals that, so long
as they can manage to exist somehow and without too much exertion, it
is all they require; to them, such words as discontent or ambition are
unknown; like the blind horse turning a wheel, they plod on day after day
in the same well-worn groove, with no other prospect but the respites for
food or sleep. And it is, doubtless, fortunate it is so, for these are
the men who uncomplainingly pass away their lives in distant lighthouses
and other lonely and far-off places where other men would simply go
raving mad in a short time. We stayed the night here, for our fresh
camels had not arrived, and did our best to make a merry time of it, the
postmaster giving us quite a feast, and producing a large bottle of some
awful stuff, which I learned was “Chinese vodka,” to wash it down with.
Somehow, though, laughter seemed out of place in this remote solitude;
for, to me at any rate, the death-like silence outside seemed as if
endeavouring to reassert itself during every pause in the conversation.
The Gobi is no place for frivolity.

[Illustration: IN THE GOBI DESERT: LADY VISITORS TO OUR ENCAMPMENT.

[_To face p. 323._]

We were astir betimes the following morning, and after a hasty breakfast
and a final stirrup-cup with our host, the caravan was fairly got under
way, and we were once more _en route_ for the Celestial Empire. We were
now over the top of the hill, so to speak, and every step brought us
nearer our destination, though we still had many weary days before us. So
few incidents worthy of note occurred during the next week that I will
pass over the remainder of the journey through the Gobi itself. Suffice
it to say that from one side to the other of it, with the exception of
an occasional oasis, its desolate aspect remained unchanged. I might
here mention how curiously everything in the desert became charged with
electricity; my furs simply crackled like biscuits when touched.

At length, on May 23, there were signs that we were at last reaching
vegetation once more, for grass began to show itself, and in a short
time, as though we had passed an invisible line, we were crossing rolling
prairies, which were an agreeable change after the stony waste. Just on
the confines of the desert we passed the Mongol Monastery of Holfer-Sum,
a curious-looking group of buildings of Thibetan architecture; we were,
however, too far away for me to be able to pay it a visit. This was my
last glimpse of Mongolia; and it was certainly with no feelings of regret
that I bid adieu to the most dreary and wearisome country I have ever
visited.

Early the next morning we were in sight of the little Chinese frontier
town of Saham-Balhousar, and shortly after drew up outside the station,
where we had to change our camels for mules. The long and tedious desert
journey was over at last, a journey on which I had anticipated meeting
with difficulties, not to say dangers, considering I was quite alone; but
the whole time I was in Mongolia I never had any serious molestation—as
a matter of fact, I can only recall one incident which might have had an
unpleasant ending, and that was the adventure on the road to Ourga.

[Illustration: YE GENTLE SHEPHERDESS OF YE STEPPE.

[_To face p. 324._]

Saham-Balhousar is quite a rising little place, and, although only called
a village, is of very respectable dimensions. It was my first glimpse
at China proper, for, though some distance from the Great Wall, it is
thoroughly Chinese in character. As a matter of fact, it impressed me
much more favourably than many places I passed through after; the style
of its buildings also struck me very much, for they were quite distinct
from anything I had as yet seen, and had an almost Egyptian appearance in
the bright sunlight.

It was here that I first saw that most hideous of mutilations, the small
foot of the Chinese women. The custom of crippling their female infants
is, I believe, gradually dying out, and slowly but surely the Manchurian
shoe is coming more into use. To see the wretched women hobbling about
on their high heels is, I fancy, more painful to the European beholder
than it is to the victims themselves, who have doubtless become quite
accustomed to their crippled condition. I have a pair of shoes belonging
to a full-grown woman, and they only measure three inches in length! The
highest class of Chinese ladies are absolutely unable to walk about at
all on account of the smallness of their feet.

It was in Saham-Balhousar that I had for the first time a real glimpse
of what over-population means. Although I had, of course, often heard
of the teeming millions of China, I had never until then really formed
any accurate idea of what that meant. This first Chinese town I visited
opened my eyes, for I saw everywhere such crowds of people and children
that I could not help wondering where they all managed to live in the
place, and the curious part of it was, how much they all resembled one
another; they all seemed part of one huge family. The children throughout
China were simply stunning, and quite pictures in themselves.

Our caravan drew up in the courtyard of the house, and the baggage was
transferred from the camels to several curious-looking carts, built
expressly for the road through the mountain-pass to Kalgan, a distance
of some sixty miles. It was well on in the afternoon by the time our
preparations were complete and we were ready to start again. I forgot
to mention that my cart still remained with us, though it was now
only a camel telega in name, for, instead of a “ship of the desert,”
two diminutive mules were harnessed tandem fashion in the shafts. The
mail-carts were drawn by mules and donkeys, harnessed together anyhow,
driven by Chinese “boys.” It was certainly a grotesque procession, and
one scarcely worthy of so high sounding an appellation as the “Russian
Heavy Mail,” and very out of place did the Cossacks with their official
caps look, seated on the top of the heap of heterogeneous baggage.

Although there is no visible boundary-line between Mongolia and China,
the difference was manifest immediately we left Saham-Balhousar. On all
sides were small hamlets scattered about the plain, whilst the country
was laid out in plantations and fields, which were simply teeming with
industrious peasants. It was a very different scene from anything met
with over the border amongst the lazy Mongols.

Towards the evening the plains ahead of us were walled in by what
appeared to be a line of low rocky hills. In vain I looked for the
magnificent mountain range which I had been told encompasses Kalgan, and
over the summit of which the Great Wall winds its immense length; yet
we were certainly near enough, I thought, for any really high mountains
to be visible by now, but nothing at all like a mountain was in sight.
It was getting dusk, and the moon rising, when we reached the confines
of the plain and began to descend a hill, or rather a steep rocky road
leading right into the hills themselves, and which at every instant grew
steeper and rougher.

After proceeding for some little time I noticed quite by accident that
the moon, which was at its full and shining gloriously in a cloudless
sky, was becoming gradually obscured; we were evidently going to witness
an eclipse, and just at a time when we wanted as much light as possible
to help us pick our way amongst the boulders with which the track was
encumbered. Much to the dismay of our drivers, it grew darker and darker,
until at last not a speck of light was left even to indicate where the
brilliant orb had recently been, and our boys of their own accord halted
the caravan and bowed themselves repeatedly to the earth, muttering
prayers and incantations. It was so weird and supernatural an effect,
that it made me almost think I was in a dream. This idea was, however,
soon dispelled, for the road was realistic and material enough, for it
had meanwhile been getting so steep and rocky, and the path so narrow,
that we all had to walk and lend a hand at getting the waggons through.

I then suddenly remembered that the whole plateau of Mongolia is more
than five thousand feet above the sea, so we were almost level before
with the tops of the mountains which form the northern boundary of China.
This, then, was the rocky range of hills we had been approaching during
the evening; we were now, therefore, on our way down into the Celestial
Empire. As we gradually descended, the granite cliffs and peaks loomed
up higher and higher around us, and so dark was the night, that at times
it became positively dangerous to advance owing to the obscurity and
the numerous precipices along the edge of which the track lay. The moon
remained hidden for nearly two hours, till just as dawn showed signs of
breaking, when she began to appear once more, to the evident relief of
our followers. Half-way down, at the end of the worst bit, we halted
for a couple of hours to have a rest and feed the animals, and I felt
so knocked up after my long and rough walk, or rather climb, that I
immediately fell into a deep sleep, from which I only woke just as we
were starting again.

It was now broad daylight and a lovely morning—so lovely, in fact, that
it would require the pen of a poet to convey any idea of the glorious
sunrise in that remote mountain-pass. We were now but a short distance
from Kalgan, but the track was so rough that our progress was very
slow, for we were still descending through a sort of gorge which looked
like the old bed of a river. The scenery at times appeared magnificent;
still, even in these wild and uninviting surroundings, the ever-energetic
Celestials had seized on every available spot, and high up the almost
precipitous sides of the mountains one could see here and there little
patches of cultivation, which in places were so numerous as to form what
looked like terraces on the side of the precipices, each plot being
surrounded by a miniature wall. Certainly, one’s first impressions of the
Chinese, especially when coming from Mongolia, are such as to make one
absolutely admire their marvellous energy and industry; this impression
is, however, somewhat modified later by more intimate knowledge of the
people.

One of the quaintest sights I think I have ever seen was in this pass,
when we reached a little village (of which I forget the name), and which
was built right on the face of the mountain itself. The effect of the
tiny houses perched right away up in mid-air, and the glimpse of its
blue-coated inhabitants dotted here and there like dolls, was quite
unique. The awful state of the road over which I was being bumped to
pieces somewhat marred, however, my appreciation of the scenery through
which we were passing.

We were now quite close to our destination, and the traffic around us
increased every moment; in a short time, a turn in the road showed me the
welcome sight of a big cluster of houses. This was Yambooshan, a suburb
of Kalgan, where lived the Russian tea merchants, and to one of whom I
had a letter of introduction. My journey across the “Great Hungry Desert”
was accomplished, and I was once more within touch of civilization.




CHAPTER XXVI.

KALGAN TO PEKING.

    A hearty welcome—Yambooshan—The Great Wall of China—American
    missionaries—My mule-litter—From Kalgan to Peking—Scenery
    on the road—Chinese inn—First experience of a Chinese
    dinner—Amusing _rencontre_—The Nankaou Pass—The Second Parallel
    of the Great Wall—First impressions of Peking—The entrance to
    the city.


The town of Kalgan stands at the very entrance to China proper, for one
enters it through an archway in the Great Wall itself, and it is only,
therefore, when the venerable portals are passed that one is really
in the Celestial Empire. The suburb of Yambooshan, where the Russian
postmaster and tea merchants live, is quite a little town in itself,
outside the wall. As I had a letter of credit on one of these gentlemen,
a M. Bassoff, of the firm of Kargovine and Bassoff, I went straight to
his house, in order to get some Chinese money and to exchange the brick
tea I still had left, for this ponderous currency was now of no further
use to me. It is almost unnecessary for me to state, that I was received
with the usual Russian courtesy and hospitality. M. Bassoff was away,
I was informed by his representative, a gentleman clad in white silk,
who came out to meet me; but a letter had been received announcing my
probable arrival, so a room in the house had been prepared for me. Had
I been an old friend of the family it would have been impossible to do
more for me; and it may be imagined how welcome all this was after the
hardships I had just gone through. Nor was there in my mind any pang of
regret at saying good-bye to my camel-cart which had brought me so many
weary miles, safely, it is true, but shaken to pieces almost. My one
hope was that I should never set eyes on its like again. To have a good
warm bath, to get rid of the dust with which I felt literally saturated,
was my next move, and I then sat down with my host to the best meal I
had tasted since I left Irkutsk, and washed down by a capital bottle
of Burgundy. “Roughing it” has its charms, but after all commend me to
the comforts of civilization. My friends, the Cossacks, came in shortly
after, and I learnt from them that I should be able to spend two days in
Kalgan, as the mail would not be ready to start for Peking sooner. So I
was to be in clover for the next forty-eight hours.

[Illustration: STREET SCENE, YAMBOOSHAN: SHOWING THE “GREAT WALL” ON
MOUNTAIN IN THE BACKGROUND.

[_To face p. 332._]

Yambooshan is one of the quaintest little places I was ever in. It
looks more like some little far-away village nestling under the Alps
in Northern Italy than a Chinese settlement, the high mountains which
surround it, and amongst which the houses are perched here and there,
helping to carry out the illusion. It is so completely encircled, in
fact, by the mountains, that the cold wind from the desert but rarely
reaches it, and the temperature when I was there was simply delightful.
As I smoked my cigar while strolling round the garden of the house in the
genial sunshine after lunch, I felt a sense of enjoyment and physical
repose such as can only be experienced after a long spell of discomfort
has been endured. It was almost sufficient to compensate me for the
wearisome journey I had just finished.

During the afternoon, accompanied by a Chinaman as guide, I went for
a ride round the city. Before, however, describing Kalgan itself, I
suppose I ought to give my “impressions” of the Great Wall, this huge and
indelible record of a nation’s panic, and which is often spoken of as one
of the Seven Wonders of the World.

Although there are really two great walls, the one at Kalgan—the “First
Parallel,” as it is called—is, I believe, the only real and original one.
The other, at the top of the Nankaou Pass, which I shall have occasion to
describe later on, though in reality far and away finer, was evidently
of much later construction, and possesses real architectural beauty;
whereas the one at Kalgan looks at first sight more like an Irish stone
fence than anything else. I could hardly realize, on first being shown
it from the valley, that this almost shapeless mass of rubble, looking
not unlike some huge fossilized serpent, winding away over the tops
even of the highest mountains, had been raised as a serious defence of
the empire in bygone days. However, I took the trouble to climb up the
mountain to it, and it was only when I found how long it took to reach it
that I began to realize its size. Of course it is so dilapidated that one
can only conjecture what its original appearance was like; but although
undoubtedly big, its dimensions were, to me, very disappointing. The
base, of course, one cannot measure, as it follows the sinuosities of
the ground, and in some places, therefore, is much wider than in others.
The height also varies considerably from the same cause, but I should
think, at a rough guess, it averaged twelve feet on the inside; on the
outside it is in many places _à pic_ with the sides of the mountain. I
found I could sit astride the top, so it is not very wide. In shape the
Kalgan Wall is conical, its base being formed of huge boulders loosely
heaped together; at intervals of half a mile or so are rough towers, each
capable of containing a few soldiers.

I found Kalgan even more curious and interesting than I anticipated it
would be; in fact, I could never have imagined such a sight as met my
eyes. The streets were well-nigh impassable, not only on account of their
fearfully badly paved state, but on account of the immense amount of
traffic of all sorts. I don’t think I ever saw such a busy or novel scene
as presented itself to me on passing through the ponderous gateway,
with its huge paper lanterns swinging overhead. The principal street
was simply blocked, and I had to wait some little time before I could
advance my horse a step. My appearance attracted little or no attention,
for I was in a Russian costume, and my Cossack cap was alone sufficient
to guarantee me respect—such a wholesome dread have the Celestials of
interfering with a subject of the czar. I have not been able to get any
reliable figures as to the actual population of this frontier town, but
there seemed to be positively myriads of people about, and the first
impression was of being in some immense fair, the low-built houses, or
rather open booths, on all sides adding considerably to this appearance.
However interesting, though, the first visit to Kalgan was, the novel
impression caused by the strangeness of the surroundings soon wore off,
and then the dirt and abominations of the evil-smelling place were
apparent in all their barbarous hideousness. As a matter of fact, this
was my subsequent impression of all Chinese cities without any exception,
and I believe most travellers will agree with me.

I had learnt that there were two mission-houses in Kalgan, one English,
the other American. So I thought I would pay these gentlemen a visit,
if only to have a chat, for I had not spoken English for some months.
I therefore got my guide to take me first to the _envoyés_ of Uncle
Sam. The mission station was a large brick building, standing in its own
grounds, which were laid out as an attempt at a garden, and surrounded
by a high wall. I was received by a Mr. —— in the usual cold, distant,
narrow-minded manner which, so far as my own experiences are concerned,
seems peculiar to this particular profession; and after a few trivial
remarks about the weather and other everyday topics (for my arrival
seemed quite an ordinary occurrence to him), I was asked into the house
and introduced to Mrs. ——, and we made some further attempts at a
conversation. It was scarcely more than an attempt, however, for my visit
did not appear to gratify these worthy people over-much. After about
ten minutes of digging out syllables on my part, the gentleman left the
room, apologizing for having to get on with his work, or something of the
sort; and I took the hint, and my departure also. It is almost needless
to add they did not press me to remain or to call again. As I rode away
from this inhospitable abode I could not help mentally contrasting the
reception I had just received with the hearty welcome I had invariably
been shown throughout my travels amongst the Russians, who never can do
enough for the stranger within their gates.

A couple of days in dirty Kalgan were more than sufficient to see all
there was to see; therefore I was not at all sorry when Nicolaieff came
in the next afternoon and announced the departure of the mail for
Peking on the following morning; so I had to set to and make my further
preparations for the four days’ novel journey to the capital.

The Russian Heavy Mail is conveyed from Kalgan to Peking by donkeys
and mules, carts being almost impracticable owing to the mountainous
districts to be passed over. Travellers who do not care to ride the
whole distance have to provide themselves with what is known as a
“mule-litter.” This is not only a novel conveyance to the average
European, but owing to its subtle peculiarities affords also a continuous
vein of excitement, which is a great change after the monotony of the
bumping and shaking of a camel-cart. If the mules behave themselves and
don’t walk in step, the motion is simply delightful; but this state of
beatitude is unfortunately the exception, and the bad qualities of the
mule seem to develop themselves to an exasperating degree as soon as the
animals find themselves attached to one of these litters; and as the
occupant is completely at the mercy of the two animals carrying him, it
may be imagined what an exciting time he has of it. Before travelling
in a mule-litter I had always imagined, from what I had read, that the
mule was the most surefooted of animals, and that he was more at home,
so to speak, when passing along the very verge of a yawning precipice
or crossing the frailest of bridges than on a level track. I was not
long, however, in my litter before I was completely undeceived on this
point, for we had not proceeded many miles when down fell the leader on
a perfectly smooth road, and for a few seconds I had an uncomfortable
time of it, as it was quite an open question what would have happened
if he had started kicking, for I should not have had time to get out.
Fortunately for me, he was got on his feet pretty easily. Still,
the incident opened my eyes, and I realized long before we reached
the mountains that travelling in a mule-litter is not all “beer and
skittles.” What struck me particularly was the wonderful intelligence
of the mules, as they have no reins to guide them by, but are simply
directed occasionally by a word or two from the boy in charge, and are,
as a rule, allowed to pick their own way. I should certainly in many
cases have preferred their being led, more especially when we reached
the precipitous mountain-pass shown in my sketch; but such a procedure
would have been against all precedent, and the mules would probably have
resented any such implied doubt of their surefootedness, so used are
they to being left entirely to themselves on the most dangerous parts of
the road. Still, it was giddy work, for often on one side of the narrow
path the rocks rose precipitously as a wall, whilst on the other was a
sheer precipice, without the slightest rail to protect one. It was a
magnificent bit of scenery, but one which I felt could be appreciated
better when seen in a photograph than from the insecure position of a
mule-litter balanced on the very edge of the yawning gulf itself.

[Illustration: MY MULE-LITTER.

[_To face p. 338._]

However, to return to my departure from Kalgan. Punctually at the
appointed time our _cortége_ assembled at the postmaster’s house, and
without unnecessary delay a start was made. It makes me smile even now
to think what a grotesque procession it was. No saddles are provided
with the donkeys or mules, so the Cossacks have to make themselves as
comfortable as possible sitting astride the luggage the animals carry
pack-wise, so the effect may be imagined. It is simply astounding the
amount of weight they can carry; even the smallest donkey would jog gaily
along under a big camel-load, and a man seated on the top of that. It
took quite an hour to get through Kalgan from one side to the other, so
this will give a slight idea of the size of the place. Once past the
town, we pushed on without any halts at a good smart pace, for we had a
considerable way to go before we should reach the town of Sin Fou Fou,
our halting-place for the night.

The country we were passing through offered no particular interest, as
it differed but slightly from what I have previously described. Village
followed village so closely at times as to give the road the appearance
of passing through an immense street, whilst everywhere was the same
teaming population of blue-coated Celestials. Night was on us long
before we reached the crenelated walls of the city where we were to put
up till morning, and for miles and miles we had to skirt them till we
reached the entrance gateway.

There was something indescribably weird and uncanny in these seemingly
endless battlements, standing out in black and forbidding relief against
the starlit sky; and this gloomy impression was in no degree lessened
when we at length reached the frowning archway from which issued the
hoarse murmur of the congested barbaric life within its precincts, and
immediately after our entrance the iron-bound gates were closed with a
clattering and clanging which reminded me that the civilized world was
thus completely shut off from us till the next morning. Knowing what I
did of the uncertainty of the Chinese character, I could not help feeling
that in the event of any hostile feeling arising against the “white
devils” during the night, our chances of getting out of the place were
positively _nil_.

[Illustration: THE COURTYARD OF A CHINESE INN.]

It took some little time to reach the “inn,” for the streets were, as
usual, crowded—at times even quite blocked with traffic, and in the
uncertain flickering light of the paper lanterns presented a scene not
easily to be forgotten. At last, however, we reached our destination, and
I was able to form some idea of what a Chinese inn is like. I fancy I do
not run much chance of being contradicted by any one who has travelled
in these parts when I say that for filth and general discomfort the
average Chinese inn is probably without its equal in the world. As a rule
it consists of a dirty courtyard, surrounded by tumble-down, dilapidated
outhouses, some of which are partitioned off as “rooms,” whilst the
others are reserved for the mules and other animals. The place shown in
my sketch is a fair sample of its kind. Unfortunately one cannot produce
the smell pervading the place, without which no really accurate idea
can be formed of it, a smell which, as far as I could guess, seemed a
conglomeration of sewage, garlic, decomposed animal matter, and general
human uncleanliness all mixed up together. In my many and varied travels
I have always noticed how characteristic of the countries the different
smells were; and even now, after a lapse of many years, I feel sure I
could recognize a place I had visited long ago if its characteristic
odour were put under my nostrils. But of all the “perfumes,” the memory
of which still lingers in my olefactory organs, that of a Chinese inn
will, I feel sure, remain long after the others have vanished, for it is
the most pungent and unpleasant I ever experienced.

A description of one “room” in these inns will suffice for all, as the
difference was simply in the amount of dirt about them. The windows—if
the tissue-paper-covered apertures in the walls can be so called—usually
stretch the whole width of the room, and beyond preventing the full light
of day from coming in, were of no earthly use as a rule, for the paper
was generally hanging in shreds; so there was no privacy to be obtained.
Along one side also was the _kang_, or raised platform, covered with
matting, which serves as a sleeping-place, and under which, in winter, is
lighted a fire. A small table is placed on the kang, round which visitors
squat, tailor-fashion, to take their meals. There was seldom any other
furniture in the place.

With regard to the food in these inns, for those whose stomachs are
equal to Chinese cooking there is plenty of choice, and the stuff they
give you is plentiful and cheap at the price. I tried one meal, but the
experiment made me so ill for several days after, that I never desired
to repeat it. Till I had tasted Chinese cooking I had fondly imagined
that I had a “gem” of a digestion, and could eat almost anything. I was,
however, undeceived in North China. The mere recollection of that awful,
interminable dinner, washed down with a vile, lukewarm concoction, which
the Cossacks called “Chinese vodka,” and which had a taste like what I
imagine would be tepid methylated spirits, makes me shudder even now to
think of.

[Illustration: A “ROOM” IN A CHINESE INN.]

One look at the interior of our room decided me to sleep in my
mule-litter out in the yard, which, although it was crowded with all
sorts of vehicles and people, would be preferable to voluntarily
surrendering myself to the enemy, as I knew would be the case if I
slept on the dirty _kang_; and although my cramped bed was anything but
luxurious, owing to the fact that my legs, from the knees downwards,
protruded out into the cold night air, still, somehow I managed to sleep
as soundly as usual, and did not wake up till I was disturbed in the
early morning with the noise and bustle occasioned by the departure of
some of the many travellers who had stopped at the place over-night.
Sleep after this was impossible, so there was nothing for it but to get
out and while away the time as best I could with my sketch-book till we
were ready to start, after a makeshift sort of breakfast.

By the way, a rather amusing incident occurred one morning at one of
these inns. I was busy repacking my litter, when Nicolaieff came up and
told me, to my no little surprise, that an English gentleman and lady had
arrived during the night, and pointed out to me an individual who was
standing in a doorway close by as the _Angliski Gospodin_ in question.
This was quite an event for me, after not having seen any English people
for so long, so to go up and ascertain whether he really did hail from
the old country was naturally the impulse of the moment. His surprise at
meeting an Englishman in such an out-of-the-way place was equal to mine
at meeting him, for he had taken me for one of the Cossacks in charge
of the mail, he told me laughingly. I then learnt he was travelling
through with his wife to visit some missionary friends in North China,
and intended spending the summer there. I was then introduced to the
lady, who came out at that moment, on hearing English spoken. They both
naturally wanted to know what brought me in such outlandish parts alone,
and where I had come from (for they had not taken me for a missionary, so
they said—and I believed them!), and seemed much astonished when I told
them that I had just come from Siberia, and across the Gobi desert.

“I suppose you have not seen any of the London papers recently, then?”
said the gentleman; and, on my replying that it was many months since
I last saw one, he added that as I had just come through Siberia, it
would doubtless interest me very much to see a lot of pictures of prison
life in that country, which had been appearing for some time past in
the _Illustrated London News_; so many, in fact, that the paper seemed
to have devoted itself to Siberia, for some reason or other. It may be
imagined how this information tickled me; for it was positively the
first intimation I had got that my numerous batches of prison sketches
and manuscript had got through the Russian post-office, and reached
England safely. Without, however, giving my name or saying what I was,
I asked, as unconcernedly as I could, if he knew who they were by, as I
might, perhaps, have met the artist whilst in Siberia. “Price,” was the
name, he thought. With that I took out one of my cards, and presented, it
to him, and we had a hearty laugh at the incident.

After leaving Sin Fou Fou, the road passed through some really
magnificent mountain scenery, the wildest and grandest, I think, I have
ever seen. At times the track passed right along the very edge of awful
precipices, which made me feel quite sick to look down into, for one
false step of either of my mules would have been fatal. Yet the brutes
somehow would persist in keeping as near the edge as it was absolutely
possible to go, in spite of the endeavours of the boy to hold them back.
Knowing, from personal experience, that they were not so surefooted as
they seem to imagine they are, I felt anything but comfortable. However,
not the slightest incident of any kind occurred worth mentioning. To
the mountain passes succeeded valleys covered with rich plantations of
rice, their submerged state giving a curious and inundated appearance to
the landscape. Everywhere the industrious Celestials were hard at work
as though there was not a moment to lose. The whole scene was one of
great and incessant animation; in fact, I never saw anything to equal the
sight. The traffic along the road, which was of enormous width, seemed
simply endless, and resembled a continuous caravan of camels, donkeys,
and mules, and immense flocks of sheep, and the noise at times was
deafening.

[Illustration: A NASTY BIT OF ROAD.

[_To face p. 346._]

Many of the towns we passed through were evidently very old, and in most
cases their venerable crenelated walls showed signs of great antiquity.
One place in particular, Tchai Dar, the entrance to which was through
a sort of double archway in splendid preservation, was very fine, and
doubtless dating back very many hundreds of years. Once, however, inside
these magnificent relics, all illusion vanished; it was almost like going
behind the scenes of a theatre, for the cities were invariably squalid in
the extreme, and offered a striking and disappointing contrast to their
outer mediæval appearance.

On Friday, May 29, we reached the famous Nankaou Pass, and a little
before we reached the town of that name, the road passed under an archway
through what is generally known as the “Great Wall of China.” Some time
before reaching it, I could distinguish the mighty structure standing
out in bold relief against the sky, where in places it actually crossed
the very tops of the highest mountains. I had fully prepared myself for
something wonderful, but this marvellous work more than realized my
expectations, and fairly held me spellbound for a few minutes. One can
form some idea of the panic the Celestials must have been in when they
undertook such a gigantic barrier. The Kalgan wall, in my opinion, is not
worthy of being mentioned in the same breath even, and any one who first
saw this one, and then fancied he would find something finer at Kalgan,
would be grievously disappointed. What struck me most about it was its
wonderful state of preservation, the symmetrically hewn stones of which
it is composed showing but few signs of the ravages of time. I persuaded
Nicolaieff to halt the caravan long enough for me to make a rough sketch;
but it is too overpowering and colossal for an ordinary pencil to be able
to do justice to. How it could have ever been defended is a mystery, for
it would undoubtedly have been as difficult to hold as to attack. The
Nankaou Pass is very beautiful, and reminded me not a little of parts of
Wales or Ireland. Through the rocky gorge ran a sparkling torrent, and
the boulders on either side were clothed with the most brilliant lichen.

The town itself, where we arrived in time for our midday halt, offered
but little of particular interest, as it was very like all the others we
had passed through, except that it was market day, and the narrow streets
were, if possible, more crowded. I noticed here more women walking about
than hitherto, many of them not crippled with the hideous Chinese foot,
but wearing the more sensible Manchurian shoe.

[Illustration: THE GREAT WALL OF CHINA AT THE ENTRANCE TO NANKAOU PASS.

[_To face p. 348._]

Nankaou also impressed itself on my memory on account of the awful amount
of flies everywhere; in fact, they were positively maddening, as there
was no getting away from them. One’s food, if left exposed for only a few
seconds, became covered with what resembled a moving mass of jet. Up till
then I had been enjoying a comparative immunity from insect pests, but I
should now have to pay the penalty of having continuous warm weather and
sunshine. These flies were, however, insignificant, compared with what
I had to endure later on, when the mosquitoes and sandflies never for a
moment left me alone night or day.

We were now rapidly nearing the end of our long journey, and evidently
beginning to get in touch, so to speak, with the capital, the country
becoming if possible even more cultivated, and the stream of traffic
along the road more and more congested. I now began to get a slight
foretaste of what heat and dust in China really mean; for at times
everything within a few yards on either side was lost in a dense sort of
fog, through which the moving, perspiring masses of people appeared to be
groping their way tediously. At last on the horizon, not very far ahead,
I made out a long dark line just visible above the surrounding trees. At
the same moment Nicolaieff, who was riding close to my litter, pointed
to it, and, with a smile of satisfaction on his sunburnt face, informed
me that the walls of Peking were before us.

Our goal once in sight, the time did not seem so long in reaching it,
and in less than half an hour we were advancing in the midst of a dense
crowd, under the shadow of the massive crenelated battlements, towards
the entrance of the immense city. In comparison to its size, there are
but few entrances, and these far apart, and we had to follow the walls
quite a long way before we reached an archway, but not the entrance to
the city itself, for on the other side of the vast walls were the inner
walls enclosing the Tartar city, our destination, a wide expanse of waste
ground separating them from the outer _enceinte_. Along this dusty, stony
waste hundreds of caravans and vehicles and passengers were passing to
and fro. It was a strange scene, and rendered doubly so by the weird
hoarse murmur of the great city so close. The venerable walls seemed
almost endless, at any rate to me, for I was all impatience for the
wonders which I felt sure were coming.

At last we reached the principal entrance, a huge tunnel-like archway
through the thickness of the walls themselves. With difficulty, and
advancing but very slowly through the throng of people, we made our way
in, and I found myself in a vast open square paved with immense slabs of
stone. This square was surrounded on all four sides by the city walls,
archways through them leading to the different quarters—one to the
Chinese city; another, which was closed, to the imperial city; and in
front of me the principal entrance of all, the famous Tchien-Men gate,
leading into the Tartar city. And what an entrance! I don’t think I ever
in my life saw anything which made a more overpowering and indescribable
impression on me than did this huge archway, surmounted by its immense
donjen-like temple; it was more like a vision of ancient Babylon than
anything I had ever expected to see in the Celestial Empire. One seemed
so absolutely insignificant in comparison to this vast monument of a so
distant past, that it produced in me a feeling akin to awe as I passed
under the walls which had witnessed so many wonderful scenes and echoed
to so many hundreds of generations.

It would be almost impossible to describe the strange semi-barbaric crowd
which I saw around me. Accustomed though I was beginning to get to the
wonders of the Far East, I felt that Peking was the most wonderful of
all. It was almost like stepping back into the Middle Ages to find one’s
self in such surroundings. The wonderful impression caused by the first
view of the entrance to the Celestial city is, however, rudely dispelled
as soon as its portals are passed, for all illusion immediately vanishes.
The abominations of the northern cities are here magnified, for I don’t
think I was ever in a more hideously dirty place than Peking. In fact,
to say it is dirty is but to describe it mildly, for I can safely assert
that one does not know what dust and dirt really are unless one has been
to Peking.




CHAPTER XXVII.

PEKING.

    Exciting times—A chat with Sir John Walsham—The Chinese
    city—Horrible scenes—Social life at the Legations in
    Peking—Lady Walsham’s “At homes”—The hardest-worked man in the
    East—Interesting evening with Sir Robert Hart—His account of
    his life.


Peking, though perhaps from its general appearance the last place in the
world where one would expect to find a good European hotel, can boast
of a really fair _hostellerie_—fortunately for such travellers as find
their way to this out-of-the-way city; and after the long and dusty
ride through the crowded streets, it may be imagined what a relief it
is to find one’s self in this welcome oasis. The Hotel de Pékin, as it
is somewhat humorously called, is part of a large general store kept by
a genial Frenchman, M. Taillieu, who many years ago came out to the Far
East to make his fortune, and has ended by settling down in the Celestial
capital as a sort of purveyor to the different Legations. Travellers are
not numerous here, so the hotel is but a sort of _annexe_ of the store;
still, the accommodation was all that could be desired, and the living,
which was a kind of family _table-d’hôte_, was excellent, and fairly
cheap considering.

I happened to arrive in the city at a particularly exciting time, just
after the anti-European riots and murders on the Yangste, and the air
was full of disquieting rumours of approaching troubles. In fact, on the
very day I reached Peking the walls of the various European compounds
had been covered with placards calling on the people to rise that night
and exterminate the “foreign devils.” Nothing, however, came of it,
fortunately, and the night passed without the slightest indication of
any hostile feeling on the part of the inhabitants. As a matter of fact,
had anything occurred I should probably not now be writing this, for the
Europeans in Peking are in the unenviable position of the proverbial “rat
in a hole;” as, whatever resistance they might offer were they attacked
after nightfall, the result would be absolutely inevitable, as no outer
help could reach them. At eight every night the city gates are closed,
and as the telegraph wires are outside the walls, all communication with
civilization is thus completely severed.

Of course my first duty was to call at the British Legation and pay my
respects to Sir John Walsham, our Minister to the Court of Peking. I had
already heard a lot about the magnificence of the palace which represents
Great Britain in the capital of the Celestial Empire, but I was
unprepared for the gorgeous temple-like structure standing in a spacious
compound into which I was ushered. It was like a big work of art, and in
no way spoilt by the evidences of female taste and handiwork I saw on all
sides in the luxurious reception-rooms.

Although, beyond my credentials as correspondent of the _Illustrated
London News_, I was unprovided with any letter of introduction, I was
immediately received in a most friendly and informal manner by courteous
Sir John Walsham, and we had quite a long chat together. Sir John seemed
somewhat surprised at my having been permitted to come through China
from Kalgan, and still more so when I informed him I had accompanied
the Russian mail. The reason of his surprise I could only conjecture.
One subject led to another, and I gradually learnt a lot of interesting
particulars about the position of European Ministers in Peking. Although
I was already somewhat _au courant_ with the state of affairs, I must
confess I was fairly astounded when I was informed that beyond being,
as it were, tolerated, they never have any communication with Celestial
officials except on business matters, and there was absolutely no
friendship lost between them; that their position was always, as it were,
on a volcano, and often almost insupportable. This remarkable _status
quo_, Sir John added, would doubtless have to be rectified one day, for
China is an important country from many points of view. For the moment,
however, Europe had her hands full. I could not help mentioning that
I had already heard of all this, and that it was always a source of
wonderment to me that the great Powers had so long stood this sort of
arrogant insolence on the part of a semi-barbaric nation.

[Illustration: STREET SCENE, TARTAR CITY, PEKING.]

It is only my intention to attempt to describe Peking in a very
superficial manner; for, although I spent a month in it, I felt that
it would require a much longer stay in the place, and a much abler
pen than mine, to do even scanty justice to its many curiosities and
the historical souvenirs it recalls, or to give even a slight idea of
the many horrible and strange sights to be witnessed in its crowded,
evil-smelling streets, where one cannot take a step without having one’s
eyes or nostrils shocked by some abomination or other. I have heard
Canton described as the most hideous city in the Far East, but I fancy
Peking runs it pretty closely. It will give some idea of its horrors
when I state that I don’t think I ever went through the Chinese city
without seeing the dead body of a beggar lying about somewhere. I well
remember my astonishment on the first of these occasions. Accompanied by
a friend and a guide, I was passing along a very crowded thoroughfare
called the “Beggars’ Bridge,” when I espied a poor emaciated wretch in a
state of absolute nudity, lying in the centre of the pathway right out in
the broiling sun. He was in such a twisted, contorted position, that I
remarked to my boy—

“That’s a queer place for a man to sleep, Joe.”

“He no belong sleep, sir; he belong dead man,” replied Joe in his quaint
“pigeon English.”

It might have been a dead dog for all the notice the body attracted. The
busy crowds passed to and fro, evidently so used to such sights that they
never even thought of moving it on one side, or even of covering it up.

It is to live in the midst of such barbaric surroundings that civilized
nations have sent their representative ministers with their families.

Still, in spite of the many inevitable discomforts, social life amongst
the Europeans in Peking seemed to me pleasant enough in its way, for
there was always plenty to do; and when I was not working, the time never
hung heavily on my hands, for the hospitality I was shown whilst there
was quite equal to anything I had experienced in Siberia, and that is
saying a good deal.

With such a charming and hospitable an ambassadress, it may be imagined
that the life of the little colony centred itself, so to speak, round the
British Legation, and Lady Walsham’s “At home” days were events to be
looked forward to; and the _coup d’œil_ during the afternoon, when tennis
and tea were in full swing and the gardens crowded, was as pretty as it
was unique, the temple-like buildings in the background forming a telling
contrast to the white-clad figures under the trees or on the lawn.

I was particularly fortunate in arriving in Peking during the “season,”
for towards the end of June, when the heat and dust become insupportable,
its European residents betake themselves up into the hills, where many
disused temples are annually converted into temporary country-houses,
and, from all accounts, very charming places they make.

No description of European life in Peking would be complete without some
reference to that most striking personality of the East, Sir Robert
Hart, the Inspector-General of the Chinese Imperial Customs, so a brief
_résume_ of an extremely interesting evening I had the pleasure of
spending with the great man will doubtless be of interest.

It was Sir Robert’s “At home” day, for every Wednesday afternoon he
receives his numerous friends in the beautiful grounds surrounding
his house, and from six till eight there is tennis and dancing on the
spacious lawns. A delightful sense of calm prevailed in this snug and
cool retreat, which was a great relief after the continual turmoil and
dust outside, a sense of relief in no way marred by the distant strains
of the excellent band playing on the lawn—not a Chinese band, thank
goodness, but thoroughly European in all but its musicians, who are
Chinese boys in the Customs service, and who look strikingly quaint in
their national costumes, with their pigtails rolled round their heads
like chignons under their straw hats.

The entertainment was concluded, and I was about to take my leave, when
Sir Robert whispered in my ear, “Don’t run away, but stay and have a bit
of dinner with me _en tête-à-tête_.” I naturally jumped at the chance of
a quiet and informal chat with the great man, so accepted the invitation
without hesitation. By-and-by the company gradually left, and we had the
beautiful gardens to ourselves. It was such a calm and lovely evening
that I could not help remarking to Sir Robert as we strolled up and down,
that life in Peking would not be so bad after all if every European had
such a beautiful place to live in, so entirely isolated from the foul
smells and sights of the native city outside.

“Yes,” replied Sir Robert, “it certainly is a very pleasant retreat, and
it is very seldom indeed that I ever leave it to go into the city. My
work occupies so much of my time that I have little inclination after it
is over of a day to go out visiting, so I live here almost like a hermit.
My Wednesday garden-parties are my sole relaxation, and I have only
had eighteen months’ holiday in all since I joined the Chinese Customs
Service in 1859. Lady Hart left China for England some ten years ago,
and I had arranged to join her there in a few months, but every time I
commenced making arrangements to leave Peking something turned up to
prevent me, and I am even now uncertain when I shall be able to get away,
but when I do, it will certainly be for good, for I have had enough of
it.”

At this moment dinner was announced, so we adjourned to the house, which
is a very large bungalow-built structure, which reminded me very much of
the houses to be seen in the newer suburbs of London. Everything inside
was about as English-looking as it could well have been. They were huge
bachelor quarters, such as, barring their size, could be found anywhere
in England, and the resemblance was heightened by the fact of all the
rooms being lighted by gas—made on the premises, I learnt.

The dinner was excellent, and would not have disgraced a Parisian
_chef_, and although the _menu_ was written in Chinese, and I therefore
did not always know what I was eating, I appreciated it none the less.
We dined positively in Oriental magnificence, no less than eight
men-servants waiting on us; for the high position which Sir Robert holds
in China forces him to keep up a style on a footing with his rank, and he
told me that even when he is alone the same ceremony has to be observed.
It was one of the penalties of greatness, I remarked. To me, however,
unused to such splendour, there was something particularly jarring in
feeling myself thus surrounded, and every mouthful I took watched by
the many and observant eyes, so I felt quite a sense of relief when the
banquet was concluded, and we were left alone with our cigars and coffee,
and could talk unrestrained.

Reverting to the length of time he had been in China, I remarked to Sir
Robert that he must have come out as a mere youth, for he does not look a
very old man now.

“Why, how old do you think I am?” he asked.

As I hesitated to give a direct answer to this question, he proceeded to
inform me, to my surprise, that he joined her Majesty’s Consular service
in Hong Kong in 1854, just one year before reaching his majority. (He was
born in Belfast in 1834.)

“Well, you have had a wonderful time of it since then, Sir Robert,” said
I, “and could doubtless write a book of reminiscences which would be of
thrilling interest.”

“Yes,” replied my genial host; “but although it has often been suggested
to me to publish such a book, I shall probably never carry it into
effect, for once I commenced there would be no end to my souvenirs.”

“But how did you come to attain the wonderfully influential position you
now hold?”

“Oh, it was simple enough,” replied Sir Robert. “It came about somewhat
in this fashion. After I had been in the Consular service five years,
I was invited to join the Chinese Customs. This was shortly after Lord
Elgin’s treaty, when certain ports were to be opened to Europeans.
Something inspired me to accept the offer; one thing led to another, and
in 1861 I was made Acting Inspector-General, in the place of Mr. Lay, who
was going home on leave for two years. A few months after his return to
China he was compelled to resign, and I was appointed Inspector-General
in his stead. So in four years I had risen to the highest post in the
service. In those days the position was not nearly so important as it is
now, for the Chinese Customs Service was in its infancy. It has since
grown to such huge dimensions that the work it entails is something
incredible. In 1861 there were only three ports open to Europeans,
whereas there are now thirty; the ramifications of the system extend
as far south as Tonkin, and in the north to Corea. Over seven hundred
Europeans and three thousand Chinamen, of all classes, are employed
in the land service alone. The entire coast-line is guarded by twenty
armed cruisers of the very latest types, built in England, most of them
by Armstrong. These cruisers are commanded by Europeans and manned by
Chinese. There is, besides, quite a flotilla of armed steam-launches
used in the various harbours. The lighthouses along the coast are also
under my jurisdiction. Each port has its European commissioner, who has
acting under him a Chinese official and staff of assistants, European and
otherwise.”

[Illustration: CHINESE REVENUE CRUISERS IN HONG KONG ROADSTEAD.

(_From a Photograph given by Sir Robert Hart._)

[_To face p. 363._]

“How do you admit Europeans into the service?” I asked. “Have you a
competitive examination, or are special qualifications necessary?”

“Well, it is very seldom there is a vacancy,” replied Sir Robert, “but
when there is, there are so many candidates on the waiting list that my
agent in London has a sort of examination held; but, of course, a man
with some knowledge, however slight, of Chinese has the best chance of
getting the berth.”

“But how is all this supported?” I naturally asked, though aware that the
Chinese Government got a splendid revenue out of the Customs service.

“The Chinese Government,” replied Sir Robert, “allows about £400,000 a
year for the support of the service. This is absolutely under my control;
also the appointment or dismissal of all officials. The Chinese Customs
are assuming bigger proportions every year, and are an ever-increasing
source of revenue to the State. The great mistake that foreigners make
with regard to China is to imagine that she is in want of extraneous
pecuniary assistance—that she is bordering on a state of insolvency.
Nothing could be more erroneous; it is rather the other way. If the
Chinese monied men only trusted their own Government a little more, China
would undoubtedly soon be in the position of being able to lend money to
other countries. Putting this aside, China is not trying, nor has she
ever been trying, to borrow money, though many German, French, and other
syndicates have been doing their utmost to lend her some.”

I could not help remarking that this was a very enviable position for a
country to be in.

“Besides,” continued Sir Robert, “the system of such loans is contrary
to Chinese ideas; for a Chinaman prefers a short loan at a high rate of
interest to a long one at a low rate. I have been much amused, knowing
what I do, to hear of agents of syndicates stopping in Peking for months
at a time on the chance of floating a loan. In several cases, in their
anxiety to do business, they were on the point of doing so with the
wrong people. After all, the Chinamen are no better than they ought to
be; and as it takes so little to make the average European believe that
every well-dressed Celestial is an official mandarin, they often took
advantage of this simplicity of the Western barbarian. There were some
extraordinary cases, a few years ago, of people being introduced to
these agents as the Grand Chamberlain of the Court, or some other high
dignitary, empowered to negotiate a loan. They were absolutely nothing
of the sort, but were perhaps connected with officialism in the remotest
and obscurest way. In some instances, however, though not what they
pretended to be, they were actually connected with the big officials.
This was proved by the fact of the Government, though not officially
recognizing the loan thus obtained, still assuming to a certain extent
the responsibility of it, as it had been used partially for official
purposes. Very little, however, has transpired of these curious
transactions.

“As it has been with loans, so it is with railways. Undoubtedly China
will one day have her railways, but though she has for years past been
pestered with offers by foreign capitalists to help her start them, so
far the reply has always been that when the time comes the engineers,
the capital, all, in fact, that is needful, will be found by China—a
strong hint, which has not, however, been taken, that no foreigners
need apply. Of one thing I feel convinced,” continued Sir Robert, “that
China, though certainly very many years behindhand, is undoubtedly going
ahead—advancing slowly, it is true, but still advancing, and every step
she takes forward is a certain one. In spite of sarcasm and adverse
criticism, she adheres to her slow, steady pace, and, so far, has never
receded a single step. As compared with Japan, she reminds me always of
the old adage of the hare and the tortoise.”

Having finished our coffee, we rose from the table and had a stroll
through the suite of rooms in which Sir Robert dwells in solitary
grandeur. There was a striking absence of the curios which one would
have expected to find in the quarters of a man who had passed so many
years in the Far East. Beyond his work Sir Robert had evidently but few
hobbies. In one corner of the drawing-room was a large table covered
with the Christmas cards which my host received last year from his many
friends all over the world, whilst on the walls were a few very ordinary
pictures. The whole place, even to the large bare-looking ball-room
with two pianos in it, was very comfortless in appearance, and I could
not help thinking that it must be very trying to one’s nerves to have
such a big bare place all to one’s self. However, _chacun à son goût_!
Sir Robert’s office, or rather his “den,” as he called it, was very
characteristic of the man, and showed evident signs of being more used
than any other room in the house, for here Sir Robert spends the greater
part of his day. His writing-table particularly struck me as being very
unusual, for he informed me he never sits down to his work, but always
stands and does his writing at the tall desk in the centre of the room.

[Illustration: SIR ROBERT HART, G.C.M.G., IN HIS “DEN” AT PEKING.

[_To face p. 366._]

“The air of Peking,” said Sir Robert laughingly, “has a very somniferous
effect, and I feel I should instantly fall asleep if I were to sit down
of an afternoon to do my work.”

A quotation written on a small discoloured piece of paper stuck over the
desk attracted my attention.

“That,” said my host, “is a verse I copied very many years ago out of
Dickens’s _Household Words_. It appealed to me very strangely, so I stuck
it up over my desk, and it has been there ever since.”

The lines were the following, and may be of interest:—

    “If thou hast yesterday thy duty done,
      And thereby found firm footing for to-day,
    Whatever clouds may dark to-morrow’s sun
      Thou shalt not miss thy solitary way.”

“By the way, Sir Robert,” said I, “before dinner you were speaking of
going home for good. Have you any immediate prospect of seeing the old
country? For I am sure you must be anxious to do so after so many years’
absence.”

“Well, there’s nothing definite fixed at present, anyhow,” he replied.

“And your successor—have you any idea who he will be?” I hinted.

“No. No suggestion has yet been made of even my probable successor, but
so far as I can judge, seeing the way Chinese views are tending, my idea
is that it will be a Chinaman who will take up my work, for the Chinese
seem particularly anxious to take the foreign customs under their own
control.”

I could not help remarking on the immense collection of books and papers
which encumbered the room, and added that doubtless Sir Robert felt quite
in his element amongst this accumulation of statistical matter.

“Well, curiously enough,” replied the inspector-general laughingly,
“although I have been mixed up with it for so many years, there is no
work I have disliked more all my life than statistics; but, forming as it
does part of my daily routine, I have become so accustomed to it that,
though I can never like it, it has ceased to be irksome to me.”

Leading out of the “den” was a room which Sir Robert told me he uses
as his audience chamber, and where he receives all Chinese officials.
The place was furnished in a sort of semi-Chinese fashion, with the
indispensable raised platform for sitting on, and the usual small table
in the centre. There was nothing particularly striking about it except
a huge Chinese inscription stuck over the door, which, in reply to my
inquiry, Sir Robert informed me was a proverb, and meant, “Like a bird on
a twig,” which simile, he further added, is, according to the Chinese,
supposed to convey the idea of how insecure one’s footing is in this
weary world of ours. I did not like to ask whether this motto had been
given to Sir Robert by his Chinese friends to stick up over the door,
or whether it was a pet proverb of his, for I was not very certain as to
what it really meant.

We then strolled out into the verandah, and as I was lighting another
cheroot preparatory to taking my ease in one of the two long chairs which
lay so invitingly handy, with a small table between with the materials on
it for whiskey and seltzer, I turned to my host and remarked that I had
often heard how difficult foreigners usually found it to get on with the
Chinese officials owing to the contempt in which the latter hold any rank
but their own, and asked him how he managed, having to deal with such a
high class of mandarin.

“Well,” replied Sir Robert, “owing to the favour of the emperor, there
are but few with whom I am brought into contact who hold a higher rank
than mine; for I am the happy possessor of almost all the distinctions—a
Red Button of the First Class, a Peacock’s Feather, and the First Class
of the Second Division of the Double Dragon. But the honour recently
bestowed upon me is the highest that it is possible to confer on even a
most distinguished Chinese subject: my family was ennobled by imperial
decree, to three generations back; that is to say, ‘Ancestral rank of
the first class of the first order for three generations, with letters
patent.’ The value of this decree may be estimated from the fact that at
the same time the emperor ennobled his own grandmother in like fashion,
she having been an inferior wife of the Emperor Taou Kwang, in whose
reign took place the first opium war.”

Although Sir Robert was too modest to refer to them, most people are
aware that he holds also many of the most coveted of European decorations
also, such as the Knight Grand Cross of St. Michael and St. George, and
Grand Officer of the Legion of Honour, etc.

I was on the point of asking further questions, when I noticed my host
glancing surreptitiously at his watch. Mechanically I followed suit, and
found that, absorbed in such an interesting conversation, the hours had
flown by, and it was already past midnight, an unprecedented hour for
Peking; so without delay and with hearty thanks to my kind entertainer I
took my leave.

While returning to my hotel I could not help pondering on the wonderful
career of the man, and his devotion to the nation which has done so
much for him, as is shown by his refusal in 1885 of the post of British
minister to China, which was offered him. Nevertheless, he still keeps a
warm corner in his heart for the country of his birth, as is shown by the
fact, according to what one generally hears in China, that an Irishman
in his service has better chance of quick advancement than any other
nationality.




CHAPTER XXVIII.

PEKING (_continued_)—AND HOME.

    Difficulty of sketching in the streets—My journey from Peking
    to Tientsin—A Chinese house-boat—The Peiho River—Tientsin—From
    Tientsin to Shanghai—And home.


I don’t think I was ever in a place where it was more difficult to sketch
out in the open than Peking. I tried it on several occasions, and nearly
always had to abandon my intention, for almost immediately I produced
my sketch-book, and before even I had time to commence operations, I
would be absolutely hemmed in on all sides by a dense crowd of dirty
insolent rascals, who, as a rule, seemed far more interested in me than
in what I was sketching. It was absolutely useless getting my “boy” to
ask them civilly to move on one side, as this only appeared to cause
greater amusement among them, and, of course, it would have been absolute
madness to lose one’s temper, so I generally gave in, and beat a retreat.
Naturally there were a few quiet spots where one could work undisturbed,
such as on the city walls, but the _coup d’œil_ one got from such an
elevated position was not to be compared with that in the midst of the
busy throngs. As ill luck would have it, I had run short of photographic
films, so my Kodak was useless.

There was so much to see in the various quarters of Peking that one
could spend hours simply roaming about looking at the shops, or rather
open booths. The Chinese city was far and away the most interesting. Its
narrow streets, which were darkened by the immense number of sign-boards
hanging overhead, resembled an immense bazaar where everything
conceivable almost could be purchased. The “curio-hunting” fever came
over me like it does over all new-comers to the Far East, and many were
the good bargains I imagined I had made, although, doubtless, I shall
find that most of the things could have been bought cheaper in London.

Of course I did the “lions” as completely as possible, and visited
the theatres and the opium dens, and saw enough temples and monuments
to last me for many years, and witnessed scenes which made it hard to
realize that all these relics of the barbarism of the Middle Ages were
within touch of the civilization of the nineteenth century. Still, I
could not help coming to the same conclusion as Sir Mackenzie Wallace,
and thoroughly agree with him that “sight-seeing is the weariness of the
flesh;” so at last I made up my mind to bid adieu to all my hospitable
friends and make another move on my homeward journey, for I still had
many weary miles to traverse before I reached Old England again.

There are two ways of getting to Tientsin, the port of Peking, where one
embarks for Shanghai—either in what is known as a Peking cart, or by
house-boat. Having already had some not altogether delightful experiences
of these native carts, it did not take me long to decide which mode
of conveyance to use, and although I learnt that the river route was
considerably longer I settled at once to go by it.

As luck would have it, just as I had made all my arrangements to start,
I managed to find a very genial companion for the journey in Mr. Savage
Landor, a traveller and roving artist, whose acquaintance I had made
whilst in Peking. This gentleman, who had just returned from Japan,
was on his way to Australia, so we arranged to go as far as Shanghai
together. Travelling in company is undoubtedly more pleasant than alone,
more especially if one’s companion has tastes at all in sympathy with
one’s own, and in this particular instance it was especially so, for the
three days’ uneventful journey to Tientsin passed away very agreeably.
We had taken the precaution of providing ourselves with a “boy” to act
as servant and cook; and a very excellent _chef_ did he make, the little
dinners he gave us being quite works of art in their way, considering
his limited culinary arrangements. _Il va sans dire_ that we had stocked
our larder before starting with a plentiful supply of delicacies, as we
had been informed that nothing except nameless Chinese abominations could
be purchased _en route_.

The house-boat, which we had previously secured, was lying in the river
Peiho at Tungchow, the nearest point to Peking, and to reach it we had a
six hours’ journey before us down the canal, in a small open boat. Our
baggage we sent on ahead of us by cart.

It was on an absolutely perfect day in June, with the sun shining in a
cloudless sky, that I bid a fond (and I hope last) farewell to dirty
Peking, and started on the final stage of my journey towards the Yellow
Sea. After a not unpleasant, though somewhat tedious journey down the
canal, we eventually reached Tungchow, and went on board the “yacht,”
where we found that Joe, our boy, had got quite a nice little supper
ready for us.

A Chinese native house-boat, though undoubtedly admirably adapted for its
purposes, is certainly not what one would term a luxurious craft, nor one
in which I should care to linger longer than was absolutely necessary. It
is a very long vessel, partially decked over, with the saloon amidships,
the galley aft, and the men’s quarters “up for’ard.” Its rig consists
of one mast, with the usual Chinese picturesque mat-sail. The crew is
usually composed of five men and the master.

[Illustration: MY HOUSE-BOAT.]

Although perhaps not scrupulously clean, the cabin, by candlelight at
any rate, looked all right, and for a wonder did not smell over-stuffy,
as such places usually do; so as we sat down to supper we congratulated
ourselves on at least having decent quarters for the next two days. While
we were eating our meal, talking of one thing and another, I happened
to remark that we were doubtless fortunate in getting this particular
house-boat, for I had heard that as a rule these craft simply swarmed
with vermin of all sorts, whereas this one seemed absolutely free from
them, as I had not detected any sign of “life” about the place. The words
were scarcely out of my mouth when I noticed Landor, who was seated
opposite me, smile and look at the wall behind me. I glanced round, when
to my horror I saw coming towards us what looked like a long procession
of positively the biggest blackbeetles and cockroaches I ever set eyes
on, and which, doubtless attracted by the food, were making for the
table. I have such a natural loathing of these filthy creatures that
I cleared out on to the deck in no time, and, as may be imagined, my
supper was abruptly ended. We then discovered that the saloon was simply
infested with all sorts of playful creatures, which, though perhaps
presenting some interest to the entymological student, certainly offered
no attraction from an artistic point of view. I decided without much
hesitation that sleeping on deck in the open air under the canopy of the
stars would be preferable to an unconditional surrender of my person
during the dark hours to this watchful enemy; so when “sweet slumber
beckoned us to her arms,” I betook myself to a downy couch, consisting
of an old sail thrown over two packing cases on the fore-deck, whilst
Landor, relying on the merits of Keating’s powder, retired to the
sleeping-apartment of the cabin, and barricaded himself inside quite a
magic circle of “vermin-killer.”

These trivial discomforts did not, however, interfere with our enjoyment
of the trip and the novel scenes around us, for from the time we left
Tungchow till we reached Tientsin the winding river was one continuous
and ever-changing panorama of life and movement. I don’t think I ever
before saw such an immense number of boats on any river as we passed
during that journey, all apparently of the same size and pattern, and
as usual positively crowded with human beings. As far as the eye could
see on either side, owing to the flatness of the scenery and the many
turns in the river, the country seemed absolutely planted, so to speak,
with huge mat sails, and the effect was indescribably strange. All this,
added to the teeming crowds at work in the fields, presented a scene of
population the like of which I imagine could not be witnessed anywhere
but in China.

We reached the last village before Tientsin too late for the boat to
be able to proceed that evening, as the river, we learnt, was closed
after a certain hour; so, rather than spend another night on board when
so close to a decent hotel, we decided to leave the boy in charge of
our belongings, with instructions to bring them on the first thing in
the morning, and to go across country to the town in some conveyance.
With some difficulty two jinrickshas were procured, and with two boys
in the shafts of each, we started off at a good pace for our goal. This
was my first experience of these convenient little carriages with their
apparently indefatigable human steeds in the shafts, and very pleasant
did I find the motion, more especially with the recollection of my recent
travels fresh in my memory.

We had about six miles to go, and the whole way the two boys went at
a quick run, only stopping once or twice to change places between the
shafts. Gradually the native houses on either side of the broad road
began to get more numerous. On the horizon in front I could make out that
indefinable sort of glare which by night seems to hang over all large
towns, whilst, as though to assure me that my long journey was at length
over, the distant sound of the whistle, of some large steamer in the
river came wafted to my ears on the calm evening air; and when shortly
after I found myself passing through fine well-arranged avenues and
streets lighted by gas, I felt this really was the end of my discomforts,
the fact of our finding excellent accommodation and a most obliging
landlord at the Globe Hotel, where we put up, helping not a little to
increase this pleasurable feeling.

We found we had about twenty-four hours before the steamer started for
Shanghai, so had ample time to look round and see all there was to be
seen of this busy place. The next day, therefore, passed rapidly enough,
and after a delightful little dinner at the British Consulate with
Mr. and Mrs. Brennan, we went on board the s.s. _Hsin-Yu_ in the very
best possible spirits; in fact, I don’t remember ever feeling happier
than I did when I found myself once more on a well-appointed ship, and
with the feeling that I had safely accomplished the greater part of my
self-imposed task.

The trip to Shanghai occupied three and a half days, the weather being so
delightful that it was quite like yachting in the Channel. The _Hsin-Yu_
was a fine steamer of some 1500 tons, belonging to the China Merchants
Company, manned by Chinese, but officered entirely by Europeans. She had,
I learnt, the proud privilege of flying the “Greyhound” flag of the East.
We called in at Chefoo, and remained there long enough to have a hasty
look round this quaint little semi-English village. Then on again to
Shanghai, where I arrived on June 26, 1891.

And here I will leave you, kind reader, for my long and arduous ten
months’ pilgrimage across the vast Continent of Asia was thus complete—a
pilgrimage which, although full of hardships and discomforts, was fully
compensated by my strange and delightful experiences, so much so that in
spite of all I should be glad of an opportunity to do many parts of it
over again.

Nought remained for me now but to choose my route home. This I eventually
decided to make _viâ_ Japan and America, thus completing a circuit of the
globe by an entirely novel route.

        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project

contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.

The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
