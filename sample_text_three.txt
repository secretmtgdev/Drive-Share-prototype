BELLINGHAM, Wash, — A man is facing charges for a hate crime and assaulting a child after police said he punched an 11-year-old Black student in the face during a school field trip.

Bellingham police said it's clear from video of the incident and statements made during and after the assault that the student was being targeted because of his race.

Police arrested 42-year-old Paul Bittner who is now facing charges for a hate crime and assaulting a child.


“These set of circumstances is extremely rare, in fact in my 20 years of doing this job, I’ve never seen anything like this,” Bellingham Police Chief Chief Rebecca Mertzig told KOMO News. “It’s not conducive to our community, it’s absolutely disgusting, and we don’t see that very often at all.”

Students from Whatcom Middle School were walking back to their school from a field trip nearby on Wednesday, and they happened to be right in front of the police station when a man suddenly crossed the street and punched the 11-year-old student in the face chipping his tooth.
